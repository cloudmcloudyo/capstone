KRAMER: (opening the door) Ah, the plane crashes.
ELAINE: No. The plane crashes? The plane crashes?
JERRY: I don't know.
ELAINE: What about the shoes?
JERRY: You got any of those?
ELAINE: No. I think I'll have a look at that. (Phone rings)
JERRY: (answering the phone) Hello. (scene cuts to the back of the restaurant)
KRAMER: (shouting) How ya doin'? (Jack in Florida)
JACK: Elaine, we need you to help find that plane. Elaine, you and Kramer.
ELAINE: Jack, I told you not to press charges.
JACK: I don't care about the plane. I care about the shoes.
ELAINE: You see, it's your fault. It's your stupid little idea.
JACK: Elaine, you idiots. You and Kramer are stupid people.
ELAINE: (shouting) Hello!
JACK: (waving his hands in dismissal) Jack
ELAINE: (proudly) I'm a proud American woman.
JACK: But you are a young man.
ELAINE: (sarcasm) Oh, c'mon Jack. It's not the work. It's the lifestyle. (calling after the flounder)
