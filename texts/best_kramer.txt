ELAINE: (Confused by Kramer's comment) What's the difference? You mean in a real relationship?
KRAMER: Well, I don't think so.
ELAINE: Kramer's a communist.
KRAMER: Oh yeah, I don't think so. (To Elaine) Uh, uh, I don't think you're being modest.
ELAINE: Kramer's not a communist. (She exits)
KRAMER: (To himself) I don't think that's a communist.
