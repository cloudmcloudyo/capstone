SOUP NAZI: You.
JERRY: So, I'm hungry. Where is the Soup Nazi?
GEORGE: I don't know. He goes by real soon- Jason Todd. I think he's deceased. I'm gonna check.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: I hit him hard with the bread. Sticks his hands together, "Sourd." He cries. (Elaine's Apartment)
ELAINE: He's not the Soup Nazi.
JERRY: He's the Soup Nazi. You told him. You can't let him get away with this.
ELAINE: I tried.
JERRY: He's got a bad habit of slipping the bread into the refrigerator.
