JERRY: Maybe I've done something wrong. I just don't feel like going through what he went through. Maybe my mother will call me as soon as she gets home.
KRAMER: Good luck.
JERRY: See you on the other side.
KRAMER: Good luck.
ELAINE: Sorry I missed the train.
JERRY: Look, dad I'm sorry but it's just a museum exhibit.
RITA: Oh.
KRAMER: Jerry, this doesn't look right to you.
RITA: Oh look. Look at him! (She turns and see Jerry staring)
JERRY: Ho ho Ho
KRAMER: What look you got?
RITA: Oh I see. Look at his face. Are you sure?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. His eyebrows, eyebrows, he's bald.
RITA: I saw him look younger.
JERRY: What's a bald guy's age?
KRAMER: Oh, well what's the young man's? If you look younger you're not gonna have more money.
RITA: What's money?
KRAMER: Yeah. George having a cigarette
GEORGE: I didn't intend on telling anybody. I was just in a stage so it's not like I'm smoking.
RITA: There were three of us. There was 3 that smoked
GEORGE: Why? We made a mistake.
RITA: How dare you?
GEORGE: I thought we would figure it out.
RITA: Well what made you change your mind?
GEORGE: What?
RITA: You're a grown man.
GEORGE: A grown man? Really?
RITA: Yes.
GEORGE: No.
RITA: You're a porno.
GE
====================
JERRY: Does that thing fit in here?
GEORGE: (Realizing) It doesn't fit in here. His head is becerrappin' straight I two. (Enter Elaine)
ELAINE: Hi. (Surveys map of the danger zone)
GEORGE: Hey. Where is Scotland?
JERRY: Don't you think it's a little...off...on.
GEORGE: (Pointing) Yeah, that's right. Geordie's got a problem with that.
JERRY: You know, the guy over there had very different tastes. (Newman enters)
GEORGE: (Eating popcorn) Uh, Babs, what's your take on the Drake?
ELAINE: I'm a fan.
GEORGE: A Babs with a Drake? What is that?
JERRY: (Out of it) You think Babs with a Drake has a Drake, I don't know.
ELAINE: Drake? No.
JERRY: What do you mean they have a Drake?
GEORGE: It seems like every couple of years someone changes the name to a Drake.
ELAINE: I mean they don't change it until they have 6 kids.
GEORGE: Ah, it's a little strange.
JERRY: It's surprising.
GEORGE: It's surprising.
ELAINE: All right, (Gets up and heads for the elevator) where is Glenn.
GEORGE: Hey, where's Kramer.
ELAINE: I'm glad you're here. I got lunch, how's the car doing up there?
ELAINE: Ooh. Is Glenn apprised of this?
GEORGE: Oh, I'm sure it's him.
ELAINE: Newman actually needs all of us to mediate between him and me.
GEORGE
====================
JERRY: Why didn't Lee, Bogus, switch?
ELAINE: What, Bogus?
KRAMER: Those guys, that was origwrt the uh two most fun guys to be with, to be with...
JERRY: Yeah, well, I also got to say, you ready? Did you have fun with him one night.
ELAINE: Excuse me....did you have fun with Peterman the other night?
JERRY: What, what about him?
ELAINE: Did you have fun with Peterman the night we went to the movies?
JERRY: .... Uh, well, what about him?
ELAINE: Well, I uh, skipped the popcorn and that popcorn, uh, hopped the dog, so he grabbed it and he plummeted to the ground, uh, where he is today because of his poor taste in movies.
KRAMER: Those kids aren't gonna green hot. (Kruger's Truck)
WAITRESS: Well, David, I'm glad you could make it. You'll have plenty of time to finish your check.
ELAINE: What's the rush?
WAITRESS: (Apologising) There is no chance I can ease the pain... Jerry jumps up and walks out.
ELAINE: Is he okay?
JERRY: I don't know. He jumps off the roof.
ELAINE: Oh no....]
GEORGE: I thought everyone at work was gonna be framing Jason.
JERRY: 'Cause I was framing it for him.
GEORGE: You couldn't find a fur cloacal for him.
JERRY: He was sleep over?
GEORGE: Did you get a nightcap or something?
JERRY: Each one of us had to take a separate nap to rest.
GEORGE: Anyway
====================
JERRY: She's my friend. You know if she's on the phone...
ELAINE: of course her number's...
JERRY: Yeah...
ELAINE: uh uh...
JERRY: She has a boyfriend...? Answers from the extremely handicapped phone numbers in the lobby. David, Jerry, and Kramer.
DAVID: Oh, David. Hi! Ready to go.
KRAMER: Great!
DAVID: Yeah. It was nice to meet you.
JERRY: Nice meeting you, too.
DAVID: Yeah. Thanks for coming in.
KRAMER: Hey, David.
DAVID: Hi! Nice to meet you.
JERRY: Hi.
DAVID: You too?
JERRY: Yeah. Jake Jarmel, this is David.
DAVID: Hello, Jake.
JAKE: Hi!
JERRY: Oh, hi. I was just talking to you and--
DAVID: You're the handicapped man!
JAKE: Well, I'm the tour group executive. Together we'll get the numbers for the forty-eight teams. It's going to be a huge win!
JAKE: That's what I'm calling out right now.
ELAINE: alright, get on the other side, honey?
JAKE: Yeah. Yeah. Who's gonna? Yeah, we'll go over there, where? Oooh! We went over there, went over there!
ELAINE: you went over there?
JAKE: The tour bus...
ELAINE: Where?
JAKE: Coney Island. I was just flipping around the shades for that guy.
ELAINE: I'm gonna go, too.
JAKE: Get off the bus!
ELAINE: What for?
JAKE: I dunno, get some reasonable person
====================
JERRY: (proffering) What's this?
NINA: Rose says she doesn't want to see you, but you are supposed to keep your eye on her. George turns the television on in his office, as Jerry holds his invention on the table in front of Nina.
KRAMER: (admiring Jerry) Well, I really don't feel like working. You know... I just hope that mechanic guy over there doesn't get a breakdown in the building from an idly's by. Kramer gets up and heads for his bedroom. (Eighty-sixth Street) Elaine walks down the street. Her hand raises her walkman, and she picks up her watch. She does not look disappointed.
ELAINE: Well, it was just an accident.
JERRY: (indicating) Oh. That's okay. I should go meet somebody. Elaine starts to go and get something to wear. She does not look relieved.
ELAINE: (disappointed) Oh. (It's back to her usual joviality) Anyway, as Elaine is leaving, I hear a guy behind her, to demonstrate his wares. Elaine looks down at her watch.
ELAINE: (defensive) Doesn't look too proud of something. Elaine slaps him.
JERRY: Are you sure?
ELAINE: (desperate) Jerry! He is not my thou! The guy is behind her. The phone rings. Elaine shows Jerry the watch.
JERRY: Hello? Yeah, it's Elaine. Look, he didn't tell me he had a job yet, I brought my watch. Jerry takes a sip of water from the fridge.
JERRY: (to waiter) I'm waiting for my bet, and... you had a little problem.
ELAINE: (apologetically) I'm having the maid get checked out.
JERRY: (
====================
JERRY: George, I'm sorry.
GENNICE: That's dumb. It's not possible.
JERRY: Nobody give a damn. That Algonquin might have a pecan soup at some bar or something has never been invented in the, like, a, 300 years.
ELAINE: You think that lunch would make you feel any better?
JERRY: It doesn't make me feel any better. And neither would you, because you don't know anybody in the Algonquin who would say "free lunch" to a male executive. (Scene ends) (Night club)
GEORGE: The reason I'm wearing women's underwear at the party is so I don't get caught, you know. I think it's just a little uncomfortable. You know, I don't *wear* underwear, you know. I'm tucked in, I'm tucked, I'm tucked, yeah...
JERRY: So what do you do, you introduce the group of people you want to attract, you single-handedly lift the coffee table here. (Scene ends) (Night club)
JERRY: The only reason I am standing here today is so I can apologize. You see, the only reason I can be standing here today is so I can apologize and apologize, (Scene cuts to George) I'm a grown man, you understand? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, (A waiter - turning to George - gives him a sour look) You have a little crush on me. Really? No? No? You do not understand? I have this special little bathroom in there, you know (Pointing the pee-drier at Jerry) where you can just use the knob and it goes right to the sink, and the water comes out exactly where you like it. I - I can't get that. C'mon, please? Please, just make it so. Please. I love that,
====================
JERRY: Hmm. (Monk's Restaurant - Jerry) (George is sitting at the booth buying Chinese food)
GEORGE: I'm in there. I just order for you.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
GEORGE: Tell me your gorge. (pauses) I don't know how you're gonna get your goin' there, but I guess you got a point about the toilet bowl.
JERRY: Exactly.
GEORGE: But I want it. I want it to be the thing that changes, that it ever gets. I mean, I'm gonna take my pants off, I'm gonna replace them, I'm gonna get an extra one for free, I'm gonna buy a new pair every week.
JERRY: Well, behind the waistband there's always the heavy nakedness, the chest of drawers that hold your pants in place.
GEORGE: Yes, I think behind the waist is a little bit of an attitude. No, beneath the waist there's Kramer with his big breasts. He does cute little jobs, like that, until they stop, and then the camera fades from there.
JERRY: What'd you get? (squaves his face) Get your pants off.
GEORGE: What? (picks up "unbelievable little job") What was that?
JERRY: Ah. Come here!
GEORGE: I can't stand you! You do things to get naked.
JERRY: I know, Jerry. Van Buren knuckle carries my truck. I had to clean it up.
GEORGE: And me? Come on, how much longer are you suppose to keep your furniture on top of the other?
JERRY: I 've had to install a floor mat... (picks up "unleaves) What was that? Can you straighten your buttressed back? I
====================
JERRY: I just don't feel like doing it.
ELAINE: So is it fun seeing him?
JERRY: I don't like to go that much.
ELAINE: Because I'm mooching.
JERRY: Mooching means doing other people's dirty work.
ELAINE: Do you do the breathing job too?
JERRY: Ah ha, you do the breathing job. How often do you do that?
ELAINE: Ah ha, about once a week.
JERRY: Ah ha, dirty work.
ELAINE: What for?
JERRY: I do it dirty if I have it.
ELAINE: Do you think that dirty work is a sin, a detestable sin, a fornication that we?
JERRY: Yes, it is. And I would ask that you please refer the matter to rectitude?
ELAINE: Again, I don't think you can abide by this, I'm fine if you can't do it... (Elaine is puzzled)...we got engaged...
JERRY: We can't do the act.
ELAINE: We can't do the act.
GEORGE: Excuse me, would you mind if I do it in my place?
KRAMER: Well, I'm a mechanic.
GEORGE: You work in a mechanic's office?
KRAMER: Huh? I work in a mechanic's office. Yeah, I'm a mechanic myself.
GEORGE: You speak mechanic?
KRAMER: Yeah, but I'm a mechanics man.
GEORGE: And who hasn't worked in a mechanic's office?
KRAMER: Eccentric, I dunno.
GEORGE: I don't know much about people. I don't know if there are mechanics there.
KRAMER: I'm
====================
JERRY: Yes-or-maybe you are right.
GEORGE: I'm wrong. What do you have to prove in order to become a repairman?
KRAMER: The only thing that can happen is that you get beaten up. That's what this country is all about.
BETSY: I'm pretty sure I'm not a repairman, Elaine.
ELAINE: (Jerry shakes her hand) Thanks.
GEORGE: OK, I called them. Now they want me to settle the money thing.
RECEPTIONIST: Has your job ever been held up?
GEORGE: (Looking down) I was down a hundred and twenty-five dollars.
BETSY: Is that right?
GEORGE: It's down the hill from my building. They were gonna fix it in three minutes.
BETSY: Have they ever dealt with you like the homeless?
GEORGE: For the past twenty-five years, I have been calling them and saying, "If you'll give me a call, I'll talk to somebody." But they have never came to my apartment, and they never have. (Eighty-sixth Street) Elaine is walking on the sidewalk outside of Jerry's apartment. She sees George through the window.
ELAINE: Eh, little snag. Good.
JERRY: What? A brief glance reveals George standing there emblazoned with the New York Yankees.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.
JERRY: Big catch.
ELAINE: How big a catch.
JERRY: Yeah, he's the catcher.
ELAINE: Hey, you know what?
JERRY: Hey, listen, Elaine, Queensboro-- I got to tell you-- they gave me twenty-five dollars to give out twenty-five dollars to an applicant for a driver's license.
ELAINE: Well
====================
JERRY: okay, it's fine. I have a thousand dollar army drill. I'm never gonna tell her. (winks)
REGIS: Maybe she should go call Joe Campos.
ELAINE: I'll go call Joe Campos.
REGIS: Yeah, hi.
ELAINE: Hello.
REGIS: Hi Elaine. Don't laugh! Man, I knew it. I was 19.
ELAINE: Sadly, that's just the tip of the iceberg. We feel for Joe Campos. We want to remember him.
REGIS: I know the following about Joe Campos. Please see below for more information.
ELAINE: (annoyed) How ya doin'?
JOE: The shirt you were buyin' was defaced with the message JOE LEE CONKLE CONFIDENT: That isn't mine. I only sold it to a financier for a few bucks. (Elaine shrugs) Don't you worry, I know his orgy. I was there.
ELAINE: (explaining, obviously) Financier told me to please him. I was his second call this morning.
JOE: Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Oh, I don't believe it. Well, not that long.
JOE: Sister Jaycox, this is Jerry.
JERRY: Oh, I'm sorry.
JOE: Send this so I can apologize. I just hope he knows what he's doing. (the phone rings)
JERRY: Oh, my God, oh. Excuse me?
ELAINE: Hello.
JOE: Hello Elaine.
ELAINE: Oh, hi, how ya doin'?
ELAINE: The great nude model thought I had done something wrong.
JOE: That's true. That ravishing dress, wasn't it?
====================
JERRY What if I get out and shoot some kinda of a sad picture?
GEORGE Seinfeld mumbles something and the camera cuts to the extremely ugly part of the conversation.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, you could do that.
UNCLE LEO: Really.
KRAMER: Are we almost there?
UNCLE LEO: Nope.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you don't even look like Jerry.
UNCLE LEO: I'll bet you are. If you looked like Jerry, I wouldn't have believed it when Jerry shot me last week.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, it looked bad.
UNCLE LEO: What? Too bad.
KRAMER: That was a boy shot.
UNCLE LEO: What? Too bad.
KRAMER: Yeah, those crop circles. I cropped them. I don't wear crop circles.
UNCLE LEO: You know, the think shrink wouldn't take that photo? That kid was gonna kill me.
KRAMER: Well, he was wearing a bum's clothes.
UNCLE LEO: Jerry, does that extends to him?
JERRY: No, but neither will Elaine.
UNCLE LEO: Jerry, wait a minute. I set the tone for the rest of the party. What do you see in a bum's clothes? Do I make that look more appealing to women? Is that appeal? Is it more appealing to older people? Oh, I see appeal.
JERRY: All right. All right. You admit you're a bum? You don't think that black guy could sit on his lawn chair, is that appealing? I'll leave you wondering. Could a bum's clothes be a reference to an elderly white guy from Florida? Maybe.
KRAMER: Unbounded, dark woods.
JERRY: Kind of a dreary
====================
JERRY: What is he getting en-route?
ELAINE: Nothing.
JERRY: What are you gonna do?!
ELAINE: Well I..I can't explain it to him, but I bicker with him all the time. It's a long, hard fight.
JERRY: I don't like to bicker.
ELAINE: Well, I bicker with Fa..
KRAMER: We won't be able to eat dinner any more.
GEORGE: Just get the fix you gave me. (Liquor Store)
GEORGE: All that money he's saving up? He's hoarding change! He's hoarding change! No, he's unemployed. He's, he's been through enough. They got the Crystals, which are stuck in Crystals! He's, he's been through enough already. All because of this frumpy old man from the Dime Store!
SALESMAN: Well, that's all very flattering for a, you know, mechanic.
GEORGE: You remember the other day, I showed how unemployed that man actually was?
SALESMAN: What, you don't believe this?
GEORGE: Yes I do.
GEORGE: Ahh, I see. So that mechanic doesn't know that the mechanic doesn't know that he's unemployed because he didn't invent it, he's going years without ever seeing the mechanic.
SALESMAN: Well, I guess I'm just glad it's over.
GEORGE: You know, people have asked me if I know how much money they make.
SALESMAN: I uh, made some very delicate calculations.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, you know, crudely... Sometimes... (checks the dial) The mechanic will try and hit him, but you know what? He'll base the hit restoration on your definition of unemployed
====================
JERRY: She was developing a nervous system..
KRAMER: George, I'm finding out something.
GEORGE: Hey! C'mon up.
ELAINE: Got something to say, Kramer?
KRAMER: No, but I gotta say this thing is pretty sloppy.
GEORGE: What I said?
KRAMER: Well, I don't remember you saying anything.
GEORGE: What did you say? (he grabs Jerry's lap - obvs) No, I didn't.
KRAMER: (as Jerry gets out, Kramer darts out) Hey, uh, excuse me. I..I'm kind of getting tired of this. Mmm..
JERRY: I think that's it. Huh?
JERRY: (he ignores Kramer) Well, I'm going to find out if that fake weight gain is real, so there won't be a lot of pretending it.
KRAMER: Ooh, fake check.
JERRY: I know what I'm talking about. Too much fake weight. (weakly) Yeah.
KRAMER: Don't lie to me.
JERRY: You know, if everybody knew it was real, maybe you wouldn't have built those fences.
KRAMER: I know I wouldn't build fences. I mean, you could get a jeep to drop fences. Just take the driver's door.
JERRY: Maybe you should let the cat climb in.
KRAMER: How 'bout a double boiler? You know, put some firewood on it. I don't want any wood on it. What happens if the guy calls the mechanic?
JERRY: (sarcastic) Oh.. that's funny.
ELAINE: Get in the car.
KRAMER: Maybe we should put these in the trunk.
JERRY: What
====================
JERRY: Before I get started, I just wanna point out that I did not close on that bodega right beneath Jerry's butler. Jerry shuffling to his seat.
JERRY: All right.
KRAMER: (in a hoarse whisper) Jerry! (gets up) Jerry!!! (Outside Liquor Store) Elaine and Jerry are in another store, this one with the deli counter.
ELAINE: You know I can't find my butler.
JERRY: I know. I knew you could.
ELAINE: I didn't know you could sell your wares.
JERRY: You know what, I don't go out all night with your butler, you know that. It's very hard to get a good night's sleep.
ELAINE: Hey I could give you a good night's sleep, I'm sure that you're just a good looking guy. I'd be happy to.
JERRY: (still on the phone) Hey...
ELAINE: Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
JERRY: Come on up.
ELAINE: (weary) (into phone) Hey, will you get Elaine something?
JERRY: Something nice for Elaine to take back.
ELAINE: I thought that you lifted a few bricks.
JERRY: Elaine, I never heard of lifting a brick. (into phone) All set. Hope you've smooth sailing.
ELAINE: (doubtful) 1973. Y... 1973?
GEORGE: What?
ELAINE: '73, that's what we got.
GEORGE: Oh baby.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, listen buddy I can't wait 'bout your little egg salad on the plane back.
JERRY: There's a difference. Elaine, It's a very complicated
====================
JERRY: Ok. (cut to Kenny and Kramer sitting down, Jerry picks up a paper)
FRANK: Read the fat free cookie number again.
KRAMER: Yup.
FRANK: Alright. (turns and walks over to the table)
FRANK: Where's your Christmas present?
KRAMER: Yup.
FRANK: I just want you to know that you are getting your wish - we are going to make your Santa wish - you sit down, eat your Christmas present idea, and make your own Christmas present.
KRAMER: (calling over an ice cream) George!
KRAMER: (surprise) Kramer! (walking over to the bowl) Mother! (winks and gives it to Kramer) (Holly's house) (Elaine is giving Holly a Christmas present. She's looking at two presents -- one chest is full of gifts -- she swaps them for another one. She looks especially pleased at Holly giving him one of hers.)
HELEN: So you're giving Holly my gift?
ELAINE: (winks and snickers) How does it look to you? (crying) ...w-w-w-w- (makes the sound of glass breaking)
HELEN: How does it look to you? (makes a sound of breaking glass, and lifts up her hands)
ELAINE: (makes childish sounds) Come on! (drops one)
HELEN: Give it back, Morty.
MORTY: What are you gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do! (innocens makes sound of turning and laughing then takes out glass) It's a good thing I said! I'm tears!
HELEN: (as upset) God, Dad! Dad, what're you doin' tomorrow? Are you through? Are you through?!

====================
JERRY: Six inches. You tell me. I'll tell you. I can get double what that.
GEORGE: Nuh...six inches. (phone rings)
JERRY: Hello Ma..
YAH! OK! This line is long. Please enter.
MAESTRO: (adjusting his glasses as Jerry speaks) I cannot. This is very tough to read. (Enter Maestro)
MAESTRO: (acting like he doesn't recognize the words) Not quite. Are you Maestro?
JERRY: Oh, yes I am.
MAESTRO: You are traveling the world and finding the best in musicians of all ages. I was hoping maybe they had a conductor.
JERRY: Oh, conductor. conductor is practically anything.
MAESTRO: Oh I suppose they do have a conductor. I'm going to the conductor's on Friday.
JERRY: Why?
MAESTRO: To watch the recital. You know you're getting canceled out of town because you're not performing in the right town. You're not getting the service that you deserve.
JERRY: What's the matter with you?
MAESTRO: I have a junior high.
JERRY: I don't care.
MAESTRO: Okay, for me, you know, it's about the right amount of fake gum that you blew at the pool. For other high schools there's usually some harmless yet tragicomic blunder. Like in if you're not in there by the end of the week instead of the theater - then they say "we'll be closing". "That could be a problem." "We have to", "maybe we won't be closing". "We can't". "We haven't thought about it."
ELAINE: "We have to"?
GEORGE: "We have to"?
ELA
====================
JERRY: You just do it.
ELAINE: Yes, but I feel as if I need to be the sole responsability for this mess.
JERRY: Alright. I'll stop pretending. Don't pretend to be concerned about the state of the art. Okay. I feel safer pretending.
ELAINE: (giggling) Alright, well not anymore than five. Simons then reveals:) (scene ends) (NBC) (Ross' clothing store) (Kramer and his date, on his way to the door, give the impression that she had slipped and fell while working at the clothing store.)
ELAINE: ...and she did not return her calls.
KRAMER: I'm outta soup!
PUDDY: 77 dollars!
ELAINE: 72 dollars!
KRAMER: You ordered the Seven Needle!
ELAINE: (to herself) I'm not working!
KRAMER: Cash, or cane?
ELAINE: Cash.
KRAMER: You're fired! 55 dollars a pop.
ELAINE: (angry) Yeah, but how long can I be out of soup?!
KRAMER: All right, all right, I'll be out of this by noon. Jerry, I need an errand car.
ELAINE: How would you like that? There's no signs of either one. She hands George the phone, and proceeds to fumble for a button as she gets up.
ELAINE: Hello? (articulating) Who are these, Roger? They're nuns. (sees the woman) Oh hi!
GEORGE: (voice from below) Darling!
RUDY: Yeah that's him.
GEORGE: (to Elaine) Darling! So what d'you think?
ELAINE: Uh! You think th e seven needle is his, or
====================
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: The mirror. The mirror.
GEORGE: Hmm. Very nice place.
ELAINE: You see, the doctor wanted to know if I was ever gonna change places with her.
GEORGE: Really?
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Maybe she's feeling Piccicker's dampened?
ENZO: Indeed, Mr. Enzo. Yes, I remember you, I was there buying his crest.
ENZO: So you weren't, uh, sleeping with her?
ENZO: No. That was the optical illusion.
ENZO: Hmm, another night in the park.
GEORGE: Oh, who's that?
ELAINE: Strange, you realize Jerry; Elaine's new boyfriend.
GEORGE: Really?
ELAINE: Well, I figure as long as I'm sleeping with her I'm obligated to do so. And if it's what he does, then it doesn't have to be that much.
ENZO: Great, then you're her new boyfriend.
GEORGE: Well, that's a little strange. Why would Elaine want to go out with a guy who likes chocolate and ice cream?
ENZO: Could be Elaine.
GEORGE: Well, I don't think so.
ENZO: Well, it doesn't seem now, George. Jerry having a guy sleep with his wife..
GEORGE: (TO ELAINE) I'm sleepin' with Elaine!
ELAINE: Nodding off.
ELAINE: No, no. No, it didn't go so well. Would you tell her the truth?
GEORGE: (TO PEGGY) He did with the chocolate.
ELAINE: Jerry, he doesn't like ice cream?
JERRY: Who's he kidding?
ELA
====================
JERRY: Thank you. Yeah, I'll see you guys later.
WAITRESS: Yeah. Ha ha. (coughing) Hey you know what, guess what? I called Kramer and he should know about it.
JERRY: I just checked the room, Arnie is in. Don't you think he should have a grapefruit?
WAITRESS: Hey Jerry, tall isn't it? Yeah, he's like a 808 with a nostril like that and boom, speaker, huh?
KRAMER: No, no, no, what speaker is this?
JERRY: I don't think so.
KRAMER: No, no, no. You think Newman is crazy? I don't think so.
JERRY: Wait a second. I know about the nose. How'd you find it?
KRAMER: I guess you could say I moved in that I moved in. Guesser Jerry, you don't do that kind of thing.
JERRY: I have no idea.
KRAMER: No I don't.
JERRY: What kind of room is it in?
KRAMER: Ah ha, ah ha. It's, it's just a pair of stomach bumps, I kicked in a can of pee-water and I haven't heard a word from Jerry about it.
JERRY: You have no idea what you're doin' here. You are fi' crazy!
KRAMER: No, I have.
JERRY: Drop dead, nice move.
KRAMER: How much is too much?
JERRY: What, five hundred?
KRAMER: Nah, you're doin' a little better.
JERRY: As good as you are. How much was it to just pick up a jacket? Is that what you want?
KRAMER
====================
JERRY: Cosmo, Jerry won the arbitration.
JERRY: No way. Well, Wilkinson had this thing and I couldn't stand it (scary, electric play, sink in) and I got in the arbitration and the judge concluded from the evidence presented at the hearing that Mr. Wilkinson was not the rightful owner of the vehicle.
GEORGE: Is that right?
JERRY: The other thing I find very interesting about this whole thing is that it's being taken back by a judge of record.
GEORGE: Oh, boy...
JERRY: Anyway, the judge found that, That Mr. Wilkinson had the rightful owner of the vehicle, but that there was no evidence prima facie supported that conclusion.
GEORGE: What's evidence? A tape recorder?
JERRY: Yeah, well, I, and uh, I don't know how you'd see that, but I think it's relevant.
GEORGE: Okay.
JERRY: Well, where is that remote?
GEORGE: That's right, that's under the seat!
JERRY: Alright, so we'll go with the remote. You'll hear me tell you one thing, Elaine - about the baby? Something we just had to say.
GEORGE: Oh, hey...
KRAMER: Hey, baby, what was that baby funny?! That is the Michael Jordan I know! Yessss! Ha! Ha!
JERRY: Michael Jordan?
GEORGE: Yeah. Uh, look, it was an unexpected, unexpected, Thank You!
KRAMER: We saw the previews, but we didn't see the baby.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, under the seat!
GEORGE: Uh, uh, look, what was that baby funny?! You've never been a parent to a baby!
KRAMER: Right, under the seat!

====================
JERRY: What if I don't like the name of the company?
FATHER: The name of the company; Leapin' Larry; Leapin' Larry; I hate that.
KRAMER: Down boy. I'm gonna flip a bird.
ELAINE: Lenny, you're not gonna get that swing on time.
LIPPMAN: See here, Lenny, you have a big idea. See here, You have a big idea. (MICKEY, MOOD, KRAMER go to setting)
KRAMER: I told you, you gonna flip a bird.
MICKEY: You happy? Happy? What happy?
KRAMER: Do you know that?
KRAMER: I told you.
MICKEY: Flying is beautiful.
KRAMER: Flying is beautiful. Happy is happy.
MICKEY: Happy because son, my name's Lenny, I'll flip a bird for ya.
SALESMAN: Alright Lenny, get down here. George tries to thumb a stroke, but he pulls his head round and back, making sure he's not seen him. As he loses concentration, he whacks his knuckles in the eyes with his fist. He recovers and looks at George with a sour look on his bad face. Cut back to Jerry's apartment.
GEORGE: I'm not looking for ya. I just used up the parking lot on the east-west 103rd, remember? You know, you could put some place you're dead, so you could get out.
JERRY: Something I've been dying in since 150.
GEORGE: Well, you're dead. So are you.
JERRY: Well who's dead.
GEORGE: We all die young. How are we gonna make it in this business? It's not like having a baby.
JERRY: Neither am I gonna have any
====================
JERRY: (Pleading) George. Gennice. No, no, no. I'll trust you, you'll trust me, trust me..(Shanks enters) Hey.
GEORGE: Hey, everybody. Susan daft-o blesses you.
STU: Rabbi, bless?
RABBI: Yes
GEORGE: Amancipio, coming up.
RABBI: Good evening.
STU: Little problem. You, uh, you going to be changing cup tables later?
ELAINE: Cup tables? Oh my gosh Rabbi, you didn't have to screw up. All right. I will go with you.
RABBI: That cup will-
GEORGE: It happened again.
RABBI: I have a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. I, uh, drink these. You look like you're jizzing!
GEORGE: (Fake Sanity) Ohh.. Rabbi, you haven't told me you're having an affair; I, uh, thought you did it. You see, the thing is, I uh, didn't read the whole set-up - all the moves, the trios, the hops, the.. f-flavored ice cream. And, I - (Elaine laughs)
RABBI: I talked you into it.
ELAINE: What? What?
RABBI: Each and every one of you must know this, lest, y'know, you think that I cannot act on this information. You see, I have a cup of frozen yogurt on rye and water and cranberry juice a cup of olive oil and a cup of chopped cayenne pepper.
GEORGE: (Explaining) I developed a high of K last winter - I ate a lot of munchies. I cucumber!
ELAINE:
====================
JERRY: Shall I bring his car?
GEORGE: Well, I think it would be wise to you, since you probably wouldn't see me again for some time.
JERRY: Ah, I'm sure he would. See, things don't ever work out, so I guess it's okay.
GEORGE: Well, it's only a matter of time now, actually.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Now, you see, something - something is bothering me very much. Something I didn't know was going to bother me. Something that whenever I see you for a walk in the park, I know you're none other than The Beach Boys' Jim Fowler.
JERRY: Who?
GEORGE: Jim Fowler.
JERRY: You're Jerry's friend?
GEORGE: Jim Fowler, yeah.
JERRY: That is so true.
GEORGE: You gotta admit it, it's really not that big of a deal.
JERRY: I admit it! It's like.. you know, in a way, it's like.. you admit it! Yes! Yes Jerry! The BIG reveal! The BIG reveal!
JERRY: Oh, I can't wait for it! ( Peterman enters the office)
GEORGE: Jimmy's on the line. Jimmy has got 'em. (Scene moves between George and Jerry in the coffee shop)
JERRY: Come on over.
GEORGE: They can't pay me enough to get a drip in the sink, I'm a sponge.
JERRY: Well, you don't dispute that.
GEORGE: No, Jerry; Jimmy's right. I don't see how we can have an alliance like this. We have to be really neutral.
JERRY: We've got to be very clear on this. We're not engaged.
GEORGE: Get off of
====================
JERRY: She is.
ELAINE: One of my associates is looking to sell me a used car in the city.
JERRY: Oh really. That is good advice.
ELAINE: Alright, go ahead.
SHEILA: Jerry, there is somebody else you might like to help me.
JERRY: I'm going to the Soup Shop.
SHEILA: What Soup Shop?
JERRY: Pretzel's.
ELAINE: Hey, where's the Soup Shop?
SHEILA: Soup here please.
ELAINE: You're not a customer.
JERRY: And you're not even close to finishing a Julep yourself.
ELAINE: You're not even close to eating thatie!
JERRY: I'll just get a small cookie.
GEORGE: What about the red velvet velvet brownie?
JERRY: These are for a different guy.
ELAINE: Okay listen, we can't stop here.
SHEILA: We can't, we can't take buses.
JERRY: I'm sorry.
ELAINE: Shut up.
JERRY: Here's your coat. How about that?
ELAINE: Huge thanks again.
JERRY: Bye shmoopy.
GEORGE: Bye!
SHEILA: Bye Jerry!
GEORGE: Bye!
ELAINE: Okay Jerry, thanks again.
JERRY: Bye! Elaine leaves.
GEORGE: You see you can't take a Jerry Seinfeld!
ELAINE: I'm meeting Kramer in the Soup Nazi's store dressed as Batman.
GEORGE: The Soup Nazi!
ELAINE: Yeah, right, right. So after we talked, I realized it wasn't him.
GEORGE: What happened?
JERRY: I
====================
JERRY: No, not you. It's Mister, Maestro...
JERRY: ...Coincidence why?
KRAMER: Why don't you go grab some chocolate and blow 'em up!
JERRY: I'll wait!
KRAMER: Gotcha! (Jerry climbs over the falling Kramer and knocks over a bowl of chopped nuts.)
JERRY: Alright, look, I'll be right back. (Kramer forces down a bowl of chopped nuts.)
KRAMER: 'scarsdale.' (Jerry hangs up.)
GEORGE: Mr. Tamblyn!
TAN: Hey! I found your pocket.
GEORGE: Oh! Mr. Tamblyn! Hi!
TAN: You didn't get passed that!
JERRY: I'm George.
GEORGE: Oh. Congratulations, Mom.
TAN: What's the matter?
JERRY: What pocket?
GEORGE: I got in there! Help me! (They rush toward each other and the camera fades from the moment.)
GEORGE: Look, alright. I'll be there...help me! (Jerry and George struggle for possession of the pocket.)
JERRY: What pocket?
GEORGE: Well, look, he might've been hiding something.
JERRY: Aren't you ashamed of your pocket?
GEORGE: I am having trouble taking it off.
JERRY: Oh! (Monk's Coffee shop.)
JERRY: I know I can't change it, but I changed it to make room for your shower.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Every time I come in there, I gotta turn on the light. Everybody's goin' crazy.
ELAINE: Who gave you this idea? I told you not to twist it.
JERRY: I should've said:,
====================
JERRY: Oh, I don't know. Look, I'll tell you one thing; the Chinese. They really frustrate me. You think they don't mind? Cause I've been in the U.S.A. plenty of times. It's hard not to like...
KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey. Cut back to George and Susan.
GEORGE: Listen, ladies and gentlemen; I want to apologize.
SUSAN: Oh, well. I was just thinking how ludicrous that was. I mean, how do you know when somebody's going to be getting something in a glass of a different color than what you've got available at the liquor store? I mean, in a car, obviously we're going with them and they might not know.
GEORGE: Whaddya mean, you mean she's used up in a box?
SUSAN: She must have like, buzzed up on something, you know, buzzed up or something.
GEORGE: Uh-huh.
SUSAN: Would I know anything?
GEORGE: Forget. Cut back to Jerry and Elaine in the car.
ELAINE: He's going berserk.
JERRY: What kind of a name is that you have lying about you teeth?
ELAINE: Oh, it's not like I'm gonna tell you a joke or anything, but I really don't have the time to remember it all.
JERRY: You're not a marine biologist.
ELAINE: No, no. I studied them chewing gum in the marine parks. I saw kids losing their gumball at the comedy club. I know what eating gumballs is like.
JERRY: What is that?
ELAINE: Oh, well, you know it . It's a bio-degradable adhesive. It *is* hanging on, like it's that bad.
====================
JERRY: Susie, were going to look at this, but uh, I just wanted to talk to her
ELAINE: She must have told you before. Why didn't you tell Susie? I mean what makes this such a huge business
JERRY: They pick you up like an weight
ELAINE: I can't believe I just added another one to the pile Elaine; her assistant is no good
JERRY: I'm sorry Seinfeld feel free to come back. I'm full.
ELAINE: Oh Bobby, I wanna know why so many people leave the offices these morons
KRAMER: Who are these people?
KRAMER: That's fair. These people, they're part of the problem
ELAINE: Well, what do you know the difference it's a drug
KRAMER: Aww, boy. Could you smell that nut?
ELAINE: Thank you.
KRAMER: All right. You get your material you go to the bank to deposit the money. But I also get a commission for every dime I deposit.
ELAINE: No, that's too little. It's the life and death, decision for everybody.
KRAMER: You know I don't think I ought to go on the record right now, but look at this.
ELAINE: Who the hell are you?
KRAMER: What? I'm just trying to attract women to here
ELAINE: No, no, come on, listen, you don't look attractive I don't
KRAMER: No, that's OK, OK, OK listen we've tried it. There's a big difference, you know.
ELAINE: Oh, big difference.
KRAMER: Ok guys, I want to talk about this real quick, okay? I need to make appointments.
ELAINE: No, I
====================
JERRY: Seinfeld?
KRAMER: Yeah, well..
JERRY: Really?
KRAMER: Yeah, so what?
JERRY: Be more systematic. Give them a book, you know, kind of a systematic way of conducting business. I don't think that's gonna work. Anyway, so I'm at my apartment, and I go, "Fancy place to meet your wife", when the wife comes out, I open the door and immediately the cat is gone.
KRAMER: You mean the cat just disappeared?!
JERRY: Well, the cat is gone.
KRAMER: That's Kramer.
JERRY: I think the cat was probably gone somewhere.
KRAMER: So what are you gonna do?!??
JERRY: Well, you're not a cat burglar. You got mugged.
KRAMER: Well, I fled. Well, then, I started running down the street, and I ran into this old lady, and the cat was gone. So, I decided to abandon it. I looked, and I checked all the furniture, and I saw that it was burned to the ground. I put the book away, and I trotted back to my apartment. So, you know? The blond, sitting on the couch, in the middle of the living room, eating popcorn. I missed the post-apostle days. I adjusted my coat, I've still got the jet-skis.
GEORGE: (couchs behind his head) The couch.
KRAMER: Hey.
GEORGE: (surprise) Uhm, the couch?! What's that in there?!
KRAMER: The couch.
GEORGE: (couple quick breaths) Yeah, the couch. In the living room. In the hallway.
JERRY: Hello, Sweetya.
TIM
====================
JERRY: No thanks. I'm *still* miles from the exit. But I'll get there. Wait. There's a guy on the exit with us who gave us the address. Don't you *really* like to go without comforters?
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry, uh...
ELAINE: Oh...I'm sorry...I'm sorry, uuh... Elaine sees Wall Street front in Elaine's bathroom.
ELAINE: Oh God...Oh, man...Oh, that's funny, uuh... Kramer's "Reading Room Sweepstakes".
KRAMER: Yeah, here you go (on the toilet)
GEORGE: Thank you very much, that's no good, uuh...here you go.
ELAINE: Thanks.
GEORGE: Alright, any word on the coma? We got a rash all over the place...What do you mean, like an ointment?
KRAMER: No, no, no. A really strong ointment, yeah. The last thing I need is a spot of very hard shaving.
GEORGE: Kramer, I'm going to bed.
KRAMER: Well, you're lying down, you're resting.
ELAINE: Have to take it off!
KRAMER: Oh, God, you don't believe what I just ran into. I'm covered in blood, people are just so emotional. I...I...I'm gonna turn it up.
ELAINE: Are you alright? You look pale. You...look like you've had coffee.
KRAMER: No, I drank coffee.
GEORGE: All right, all right, I woke you up. George celebrates with assistant, assistant takes off gown...Lou!
DARREN: You know, George, you look fabulous tonight.
GEORGE: Yes, yes I do. The gardener picked the
====================
JERRY: So let me ask you a question.
KRAMER: Yung up.
ELAINE: What? What?
KRAMER: You know things don't always work out alright. What are you looking at me for?
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: Well tell me the truth Jerry, are you still with your friends?
JERRY: Are you sure? Look Elaine...
ELAINE: Jerry what?
JERRY: Nothing Jerry. I got a call in your building.
ELAINE: Building? What do you think? It's a gift from my neighbor because my son moves around the lot and he can analyze that strange furniture.
KRAMER: What the hell are you talking about?
ELAINE: What, you put it over there?
KRAMER: No you don't.
ELAINE: Where is the money? Kramer should have got some advice from his psychiatrist and if he didn't he'd be out of his mind.
ELAINE: The Dewey Decimal System, that's a lie. He did move around a lot.
ELAINE: You know I hate to spill my guts but when somebody's apartment's got a window that's got some serious pockets you ask them to stop. Hey I'll get that glass too - ooh ha!
JERRY: Then who're you again?
ELAINE: I just got my internship back. It's at the Plaza Hotel.
KRAMER: Wh..what's going on?
ELAINE: Are you okay?
KRAMER: I got a date tonight with Susan Ross.
ELAINE: Gee again. That's odd. Look again. The fabric of my relationship is give and take. Who makes you and if there was any what have you made me? What if I don't want to have sex again?
====================
JERRY: Yes, real quiet. Especially with the hose out.
ELAINE: OK, Jerry listen I just talked to your uncle Noreen, she's kinda upset. She wants you to go over to her office and get her lunch, but you really want to go with me to her.
GEORGE: What does that have to do?
ELAINE: I like the idea of getting in my bed and getting my feet wet. So ask Noreen if you can get in. Otherwise I'll assume you'll be able to handle it.
JERRY: Are you okay with this? Elaine probably gets some kind of a reaction from her neighbour.
JERRY: So, either get a new pair of shoes or move into this apartment. Jerry and Elaine are in the back of a cab.
JERRY: Get in the cab! (George puts his hands in the air) I don't want to hear from you! Cut to lunch with Noreen.
NOREEN: That doesn't sound right, does it?
GEORGE: Oh yeah, it does. It's hard not to get your mouth to look at something you're not willing to talk about. (to Elaine) Nice outfit, huh?
ELAINE: I think I got the haircut.
ELAINE: Oh. Entertainment, that's another story.
GEORGE: Or, she kinda talked me into getting an apartment here. There's some tension there.
ELAINE: Have you gone cold?
GEORGE: No. Or have you gone both ways?
ELAINE: How old are you, I wonder if there's ever been a bit about it.
GEORGE: And you've never slept with me. That's incredible. Is that something, is that something?
ELAINE: Oh. Yeah. And I like baths, baths, baths. You know they stink, they're
====================
JERRY: Yeah, okay.
KRAMER: That whole booth, look at the variety. You know, scratch this whole thing off and you can't even count on any one thing. (Newman enters with a box)
KRAMER: Hey buddy.
JERRY: Hey, Newman's over there.
NEWMAN: Hey. Hey! I'm Kramer.
JERRY: What's up?
NEWMAN: (Mock joy) The cloning thing. I moved into the basement a couple of floors down, I'll tell you what, I'll have some coffee there.
KRAMER: What is that, Newman?
NEWMAN: Yeah.
JERRY: Why don't we put some paper in the cupboard?
KRAMER: Whoa, why?
NEWMAN: I'm, uh, I'm waiting for you, don't want to screw up your date with Nina.
KRAMER: Soup. What's this?
NEWMAN: We have cut grass! You didn't wash! You daren't know how to do this! I just hope you have a paper bag!
KRAMER: Paper bag? I don't want a bag!
NEWMAN: Hey! This is a gift.
KRAMER: Yeah, one of these.
NEWMAN: Yeah. (Kramer stumbles out, then opens up in the box)
KRAMER: Phew!
JERRY: What is this?
KRAMER: It's a Krameres jug, what are you doing?
JERRY: It's a Van Worter Half jug!
KRAMER: Hey, how about a Pepto-Bismol Blue with three blanks.
JERRY: Ooh!
NEWMAN: (Talking about the paper jug) Can I borrow one?
JERRY: Ooh, O
====================
JERRY: Well, it's nothing. It's just a couple of bad mouthing.
ELAINE: Yeah, well me neither.
JERRY: Bad mouthing?!
SALESMAN: You know, I gotta settle down some of these people, don't you think? Like, when Susan called to say she wanted to meet me for the weekend, I made her up! Now if you like, you can go and apologize! Huh.
ELAINE: What? 'Nice trip, but I had to get to the root zone.' You didn't have to go--
SALESMAN: You look like you've got a little something special.
ELAINE: Yes.
SALESMAN: You smell like the desert you're from?
ELAINE: Yes, tastes like the desert!
SALESMAN: What's with all the yelling? Isn't he making fun of you, that's deranged?
ELAINE: Stop it, STOP IT! I mean, I mean, I am an attractive man, and I stand to inherit hundreds of millions of dollars if he wins! I was just suggesting they buy one of those high-powered corduroy tops, to see what effect it could have! Oh, by the way Gary, the uh, sidler.
GARY: Did you here that guy for the record? Didn't you explain what I was trying to get at? His name is Don Mattingly?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, well, we've covered that in our book. We've even seen it in the soap opera. And uh, it goes something like this: Kramer: Don't you think it's odd, that you find this amusing, that you even find funny, that you even find funny?
KRAMER: Yes, I don't think so.
GLENN: It's a sardonic joke.
====================
JERRY: You got the Daily Worker?
JERRY'S SECRETARY: I never read anything on the floor. I mean, to suggest they actually do sleep studies doesn't even come close to being accurate.
ELAINE: (Accepting the paper) Thanks.
GEORGE: (To those he saw on the floor) What about you?
KRAMER: (To Jerry) Have you ever thought about sleeping in a rope? (Dramatically) Is that what I'm always asking myself?
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Quik
JERRY: How about you?
KRAMER: To Jerry. (To George) Who?
GEORGE: Elaine did. She met George.
JERRY: George was ossified.
KRAMER: But he was too big for the cabin.
JERRY: Uhm, pardon me, I was just saying how I'm not interested in that conversation. That rope guy, he was about to get caught.
KRAMER: Quik.
GEORGE: Like the rope guy with the fat behind his head.
KRAMER: Yeah. Like the fat guy with the fat behind his head, he's just gypbing... (he sees these three men, he starts to visualize one of them with a sleep mask, as they are being lazed by)
JERRY: Wipo.
KRAMER: (To one of them) Since you're seeing' is all it takes. Looking! That's my dream, mine! My dreams!
GEORGE: (flustered) Tub of coffee!
GEORGE: (again, still trying to come up with an example) I had coffee with these three? My mother had to move in with them!
KRAMER: Yeah, and then they tell me I'm not registered! After I tell you I gotta
====================
JERRY: I know we shared a cab.
GEORGE: Then why the haggis?
ELAINE: Because she thinks that I like to tease.
JACK: She doesn't know Jack.
ELAINE: (cont.) C'mon, c'mon. It's not what you think.
JACK: It's the fabric of the relationship. It's the way you keep your hands locked in a game of ping-pong. It's the way you break up, when you want to chase after someone you don't want anymore. And you want to leave, you want to go. That's how trust grows. You can't allow your lovemaking partner to cheat.
ELAINE: No. Jack, stop it.
MICHAEL: It's gonna take me two seconds!olt! It's all over!
JACKIE: Cut it up!
MICHAEL: The judge decrees!
JACKIE: (cont.) If I give you my word that I drop you one---fifty, you will live to see fifty!
JACKIE: (Hey, that's the mint on the cheek here) My nose will thank you... (Subway train) Elaine and Zach are talking in the subway, after they drop Elaine off.
ELAINE: I like coffee close to your face.
ELAINE: Look, Zach, I'm sorry but, I'm stuck between being a banker and buying this bike.
ELAINE: (quietly) Yeah, too scary.
JERRY: Maybe you should try riding it in. It has all the feel of a high-school fight.
ELAINE: Well, I think it's stable. (George's car)
KATYA: See you on Monday, TONY.
JERRY: You know you don't have to say "hello to Mrs. O" before the
====================
JERRY: Did you say - you're on a pedestal, is that why?
KRAMER: Yeah. You're at the top of the leaderboard. That means I'm number one on the leaderboard. Not only that, I'm number two on the all time leaderboard. So I wonder if I'm stealing from you? (Kramer starts hacking at belt loops) What, guess what? We're going to steal your belt at the party.
RAY: You will?
KATIE: Yeah.
RAY: Where are your friends playing cards?
KATIE: I'm in the pocket.
GEORGE: Playing cards?!
KATIE: Hey, fat cats, they enjoy the distraction of a video game. So, who are these guys?
GEORGE: Who are they?
KATIE: Commando Three.
RAY: Commando Three? The same colour?
KATIE: Never been told.
RAY: Commando Three? Never been told.
KATIE: Forget the Commando Three.
RAY: Mind your own business.
GEORGE: Hey, let's play a video game. Which I didn't know I was in. And a big hit, as always. Right?
KATIE: So turn it off. (Jerry and Steinbrenner go to get it off)
STEINBRENNER: I'm sorry, Jerry, they're getting out of town. Really.
JERRY: You want the Super Mario Brothers? Okay, I'm going.
GEORGE: Now you don't understand - we're losers.
KRAMER: Hey, Steinbrenner is gonna be furious.
STEINBRENNER: All right, Jerry, we've exposed one of the greatest losers of all time, the Super Mario Brothers. You, too, are gonna be damned.
GEORGE: Hey, look, takin' down my
====================
JERRY: (Kissing her hand in greeting) Oh yes, yes.
ELAINE: Hello. How are you?
JERRY: Hi, Melissa. How are you?
MELISSA: I seemed to have a look that said things to me.
ELAINE: I was just, really curious. Were you listening to my messages?
MELISSA: Yeah, really, yeah. Kramer enters.
JERRY: ...And she, she saw Genderson, and she--and then she tells you the truth, Jerry. He's not dating, he's in a relationship. That's the big thing with relationships, they always end up with the biggest busts.
KRAMER: No, no, these people are desperate and they want everything I have. They're unencumbered by any responsibility.
ELAINE: You betrayed me?
KRAMER: I tried to stop it, but I could see that.
ELAINE: Well, I'll put that behind me. Brace yourself. Jerry and Genderson get into the back seat of the limo.
GEORGE: I'm not the guy who got that rumble.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Maybe I've been druin' him already.
ELAINE: You see, the rumble is what wakes people up, you know? Up and comin'. Ooh! Alright, what are we gonna do?
JERRY: I don't know. I'll tell you something, we're just never showin' that. Even in a coma, I don't think one of us is gonna say that. We're just sayin' 'God you're so beautiful, who died for you, died for you'. I've always been be challenged by people thinkin' that. When I was a kid, I have always believed in that. Maybe I
====================
JERRY: Well you enjoy yourself.
JERRY: So, the free ride to NYC is about to end.
ELAINE: Er, yeah.. But the free ride to NY comes with 50, 100, 200 dollars. So get your monkey heels and get your hat and we're gonna get ya 200 dollars.
JERRY: Really?
ELAINE: yeah.
GEORGE: So what do ya want me to do? You give me the discount.
ELAINE: No.
GEORGE: So you want me to go for 200 dollars?
ELAINE: No.
GEORGE: Alright, so you gotta go for 200 dollars if you want the refund..
ELAINE: No!
GEORGE: Alright, well..then I'll call the airline, see if I can get a refund..
GEORGE: Alright, I mean, let's say you don't go.. say you go to Paris, you eat dinner in Dinky Donuts, and.. (Scene ends) (Jerry's car)
JERRY: You see what you're getting into? The patched nylon of that man's shirt. Unless he's wearing a slightly sportier shirt, which is a little ways from my comprehension. His shirt is not patched.
ELAINE: His shirt is patched.
JERRY: Well, it is his shirt.
ELAINE: When the boat is salting, his shirt is shirt patched.
JERRY: His shirt is shirt patched.
ELAINE: But his shirt is not shirt patched.
JERRY: What's the difference.
ELAINE: You know, out here on land--
JERRY: My father used to trawl through his father's shirt-girdle. Sometimes I'll find him around twenty somethin', other times it's just me.
ELAINE: Jerry, you took the
====================
JERRY: Do you feel any pain here?
GEORGE: Oh f.....f.....f....f....F.E, F....F.E. How long have you been a Beltman?
KRAMER: I b....got urared....
JERRY: I'm Seinfeld. Welcome to the Beltman......Louisiana
GEORGE: This must be the ugliest scene you will ever meet. Ever.
JERRY: Horseman! Kramer rides...into
KRAMER: ...about to leave
GEORGE: it.
JERRY: There it is!
KRAMER: Into the right wing
GEORGE: Now where's the food?
ELAINE: It's an old hamburger, sir.
STEINBRENNER: 15 dollars
STEINBRENNER: What are you getting 15 dollars for and 15 for fifteen dollars for a hamburger?
ELAINE: Sir , where is the liquor?
STEINBRENNER: Oh . . . 8th street....
ELAINE: There's no liquor there sir.
STEINBRENNER: It's a dead giveaway
ELAINE: I'm the smirky one
STEINBRENNER: Yeah
ELAINE: I know we were, we're dead in there.
STEINBRENNER: It was an unprovoked greeting
ELAINE: A dead giveaway
STEINBRENNER: Look it's 8th and Broadway
ELAINE: But we picked up this invitation on a horseback and we avoided it for the whole three months.
STEINBRENNER: We could not bring the understudy problems.
ELAINE: You are telling me sir.
STEINBRENNER: This is the problem.
ELAINE: We adopted a standard of living o...that we cannot control....and sir their home is
====================
JERRY: No. Jake Jarmel?
ELAINE: Yeah, you tougher guy.
JERRY: No! Is that so hard?
ELAINE: Without you... (As Jerry reaches for the spatula, Jake smiles and disappears from the room behind Elaine)
ELAINE: Yeah. Here. (She walks away)
JERRY: Hey, I didn't lose Jake, I didn't even see him because he called me when he ran over my car.
ELAINE: Well, I...
ELAINE: When he called, I looked him up and found him on his way to a meeting at the enemy headquarters at medical school with a bent for zapping people with a baseball. You don't call somebody and complain that they didn't react as you would have if you could... he's not a baseball player.
JERRY: What I mean, obviously he could have jinxed it and gotten us all mixed up.
ELAINE: Why would I call? I only look at him as a jerk. He's a jerk. He's a jerk! J-Oh, you don't know Jake.
ELAINE: No, I don't.
JERRY: Well, maybe he watches too much on TV.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on, Jake. I wanna tell you, I'm really glad you're doing this.
JERRY: What for?
ELAINE: Do you mind if we do this for you?
JERRY: Do you mind? I'm really glad I'm doing this.
ELAINE: It's not like I'm getting anything when I ask you.
JERRY: I know what I'm doing.
ELAINE: What? It's okay.
JERRY: I'm gonna go meet this guy at the soup stand. (Elaine leaves)
====================
JERRY: buddies damn tic tacs
KRAMER: my wife
JERRY: one of your staff made a big deal about this
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah
JERRY: (he puts down the money) Babe Einstein, huh?
KRAMER: I didn't know that!
JERRY: what do you care?
KRAMER: Well just tell me what happened to my wife.
JERRY: Babe Einstein, who, by the way, is this you??
KRAMER: Oh, well, that was an excellent move for a young lady, did ya.
JERRY: Thanks Kramer. (digs in) He looks pleased.
KRAMER: Hola.
JERRY: That was a hell of a move did ya. (Kramer goes to his bag, puts his change on, and pulls a wad of bills out of his pocket.)
KRAMER: Pinch!
JERRY: What, a bill?
KRAMER: (pinching) Well, that tickles me.
JERRY: Ahh. your brains are making quite a mess. (Kramer is tickling his teeth with his coat.)
KRAMER: Hola.
JERRY: Hey, there's "Lemme call you back" in the mail. (pinching) See ya.
KRAMER: (getting up) Yeah, thanks.
JERRY: Thanks, I guess. Hey, I would like to thank you for the pleasure of your visit.
KRAMER: (positive) Oh, no no no. (Enter Elaine)
KRAMER: Oh, I was really happy to see you, but I'm going to have to carry some groceries up here.
ELAINE: Hey, there's Pam, there's Kramer.
KRAMER:
====================
JERRY: No, and there's no vet vet, so you can't tell the difference between a dog and a man.
ELAINE: You know, I'm going to be quite adamant that you never mix meat and fish again.
JERRY: Eat what you can.
ELAINE: Meat fish! That's murder!
JERRY: Eat what you can (takes a bite of meat fish) (Commercial)
ELAINE: Jerry, where've you been? .. Where've you been? Just taken out of the way so everyone else can.. just take your hat and find you later?.. Did you know that, uh, that dog had a human sponsor? Because I'm Scientologist.
JERRY: (under his breath) I swear.
ELAINE: It was a Human Psychologist.
JERRY: What for?
ELAINE: (Loss of breath) He was an EKJ. I named him after my friend.. Jerry's Apartment
JERRY: Yeah, we name-drops all kinds of folks when we name babies.
KRAMER: You know, you're not gonna believe this, but I got a name for you.. Mohel.
ELAINE: I'm Mohel.
KRAMER: Mennel, mennel.
ELAINE: Who said anything about an EKJ?
KRAMER: I told you last summer, huh?
ELAINE: It's okay, it's fine.. it's fine.
KRAMER: What, did you get into a car accident?
ELAINE: I avoided him. The baby is very, very close to me.
KRAMER: Maybe you're not.
ELAINE: No. I'm just remembering my fall in the shower at the boys' house..
KRAMER: George, mmm
====================
JERRY: Oh, again...
KRAMER: You know, you could read the paper but you're not going to walk into a room and look through a hundred envelopes and think that I'm actually going to put out one of those cookies.
ELAINE: I was going for one.
KRAMER: Must be a hot night for you
RY: I was in the good graces of one of those cookie factories down in Vermont.
JERRY: That was before we had computers. Now we cookie factories are producing over six hundred computers a day. This is not the way to enjoy the party. I'm a ball man.
ELAINE: People bring up the nagging nagging.
KRAMER: Uh-oh. Cut back to Elaine and the other lingerie parlour operator.
ELAINE: Nagging nagging, licking her lips...
ELAINE: Wearing that, slopping down a flight of stairs...
ELAINE: Uh-huh. Elaine starts the second she sees the ad for the lingerie machine, she leans in and sets the alarm.
ELAINE: (urgent) Someone...help me to find my phone.
ELAINE: Oh, mama.
ELAINE: (moving back into seat) Oh. Elaine leans forward and arms her chest way up. She has the nylon flap of hair pulled down to her waist and her eyes shut. She has the sweet flash of a lighting fan at her neck area.
ELAINE: (swirls around, flinched her head back and forth, startled by the flinch) Oh my....
ELAINE: (extemporising) I tell you? It was a bad blurb in the DiMaggio's paper..
ELAINE: Oh. So now he thinks I'm dating prostitutes.
ATTENDANT: We're going to
====================
JERRY: I don't know what to tell you.
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. No. I can't do this. I can't go.
ELAINE: C'mon, c'mon. It's got to be something.
JERRY: I can't believe someone told me this.
ELAINE: Tell me something.
JERRY: I don't know. I would tell you a story. Or maybe a flashback. Whatever it takes. I'm telling you a story. I have no confidence in you. You're either in there somewhere. Either you're lying or you're lying with me.
ELAINE: Oh, tell me something.
JERRY: I don't have a story. Is it unbearable? It is an unfathomable level of depravity.
ELAINE: I don't know how to talk to this guy.
JERRY: Well, its his story.
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey, don't press your pants 'cause I got the gloves on ... what is this, I need those gloves?
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: I got the gloves in there and I got the work plates on the hell out of ... well, the thing is I have these big, flat, bump-shaped gloves, so I spread mine out and that somehow becomes a work of art. The thing is, I have no glove under control.
ELAINE: Do you have any work in ... under ... under ... under ... under hands?
JERRY: Because, I'm working on hands for which I'm extremely proud. I'm laying out rudimentary hands. What is this today, a cake with a little white ... ha ha ... There, ha, ha.
ELAINE
====================
JERRY: I'm enjoying the sound of your voice.
KRAMER: Why don't you just hang on?
RICK: Oh, no. Kramer leans out the window, Rick holds his tongue, as Kramer tries to continue the conversation, but gets lost in the blur.
KRAMER: Aw, lean back. I'm gonna lean out! (to Rick) Are you sure? He nods, Kramer leans out and Rick smiles and smiles back, and George lets the conversation rest. (George's car - Rusty) Rusty has his head in his hand, as does George, sitting on a convertible. Rusty leans somewhat back, towards Elaine, who leans forward and covers her face with her arms.
RUSSELL: You know, George, I've been doing this a lot...my lip fits...I almost cut my lip off.
ELAINE: Well...ho ho ho...you can take your traps and go.
RUSSELL: Elaine...I'm sorry.
ELAINE: Uh...yeah. Uh...you,
RUSSELL: You have to make a videotape of it.
ELAINE: I,
RUSSELL: You have to know what you're doing.
ELAINE: Oh,
RUSSELL: Alright, Kramer. Uh....if you find anything,
ELAINE: No. Uh, Okay. So...the key is out, but the piabu can get a little dirty. So.....
RUSSELL: Where are you going? Rusty answers the phone.
RUSSELL: Don't be rediculous.
RUSSELL: What ever you are, uh...it's Rusty. T-shirts available.
ELAINE: If you want to see what's new, you don't turn your back to the television. Backlit bedrooms, cafeterias and shopping carts. In the
====================
JERRY: Ah, well we'd need some proofreading before we can really trust her. Kramer enters.
KRAMER: Uh, well, this isn't the kind of chemistry you want to have here.
GEORGE: Why?
KRAMER: An' I don't feel like spending half my money on it.
JERRY: That's okay.
GEORGE: Kramer.
KRAMER: Hey, how were the family reunion talks?
JERRY: Good. All right, gimme the benefit of the doubt. What, you did anything last week?
GEORGE: Oh, really? Oh, the family. *Really*. All right?
KRAMER: What? *Really*. It's a clog.
JERRY: Don't you think there's something wrong with the family?
KRAMER: Ahh! There's nothing to worry about.
JERRY: Alright. I got it, I got the marriage papers. She had nothing to do with 'God bless you so very very nice*, but I felt bad about the want and the depravities.
GEORGE: What do you mean suddenly? There's a weekend off, you're packing stuff, we go out maybe ten minutes at a time, have coffee and talk.
JERRY: That a thing or thing not so much?
GEORGE: I had to take a break. I gotta spend time with my family.
JERRY: Where do they get "that a thing or thing not so much"? Kramer enters.
KRAMER: I just divorced my wife. She had everything.
GEORGE: You divorced her.
KRAMER: Sold the stake.
JERRY: Sold the stake? What sale?
KRAMER: Everybody sells the stake. Kramer heads for the door.
JERRY: Hey, remember last time we went out?
====================
JERRY: Oh yeah, a basket of goods.
KRAMERMAN: Yeah, got a whole new look in.
JERRY: Well, what colour do you need it for? Brown, Olive, Blue, Green?
KRAMERMAN: You just gotta find the perfect shade for you. And don't overthink it, man. Just be sure to blend in with the crowd. Jerry, look me in the eyes..
JERRY: Okay, get outta here.. I think he was having a good laugh.
KRAMERMAN: No, he was just having a good laugh and that's all.. man, they're dogs. I'm just there waiting for you.. I forgot to catch a plane.
JERRY: I guess we lost. George being Jerry's waiter is an excellent opportunity to get coffee and to put a piece of cake on his plate. He also has a chance to thank Elaine for entering into a friendship that would be broken only by the breaking of an apple..
JERRY: A cup of coffee might be a good idea too.
KRAMERMAN: Yeah! Besides, I think I got a cup of coffee for you.. That's very exciting. Kramer ducks Elaine's question as he sits down picks up the spatula and tips it over his shoulder like it was aimed at her eye.
KRAMERMAN: You know, Elaine's a funny guy with a terrible name. Talking about George. George enters the kitchen pushing a bagful of cake out of his bag.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm nuts about this. How did she leave you a cup of coffee?
KRAMERMAN: You know, I had this ridiculous dream about you and Celia, and it turned out to be a lie.
GEORGE: Alright. Kramer goes back to the menu and tries a cup of coffee. Elaine enters.
ELAINE: Hey.
J
====================
JERRY: Yes Mr Degrunmont, he started it.
JERRY: Alright, lady, off head, I go pik, bye-bye. (All three leave) George and Daphne at Monk's
GEORGE: "Hello, darlin'. That'll do it. See ya!"
DAPHNE: What?
GEORGE: Wow you missed a beautiful day!
DAPHNE: You didn't see us?!
GEORGE: No! You were so close!
DAPHNE: (Looks at George confused) Wha...? From whom?
GEORGE: I'm gonna ask her out. (Elaine opens window on bathroom door)
ELAINE: George! Hi! Isn't Elaine already here?
GEORGE: Yea I didn't see you leave. Nothing I could do, she never showed up!
ELAINE: (Thinking to herself) Where is Elaine? The bathroom door opens and Daphne enters.
DAPHNE: What's that?
GEORGE: (Threatening) Plyosterols, ya know.
DAPHNE: Huh HU!
GEORGE: What's the matter?
DAPHNE: George told me y' see Elaine left.
GEORGE: I know what's happened. I have tried to reach her, but I cannot get through.
ELAINE: (Deeply sniffs the gums off the foam floor)
GEORGE: What is that? (Kramer comes in and sees Elaine)
KRAMER: Ohhh yeahhh..... wait a second.. wait a second.. uh to hell with... these... (Cut to H&H's in Queens)
JERRY: So my old boyfriend, Matthew, comes over.
MATTHEW: Hi. (Jerry gives Matthew a lingerie look and as the scene ends)
JERRY: Oh my gosh
====================
JERRY: Of course you do.
ELAINE: No, I don't.
JERRY: Why do you say that?
ELAINE: Well, it's a, uh...
JERRY: Funny that you do sound a lot like George!
ELAINE: Yeah, ha ha...You sound a tad like George from Yankee.... Yeah, ha ha ha...George also goes by the number 997 ...George, ... you...are indeed 9.. ..George, you...are indeed 9.. You sound like a very nice guy George, ... 9.. 9.. You sound a lot like George from Yankee Stadium And you apparently have a very uh...personal connection with George. Do you have a person that you would know, say...Ham.... Could be a very bad person. Could be a person that you've never met, .. George has caused quite a stir in the amateur tennis community recently when, he has apparently insulted Kennebunkie ... Kennebunkie. Yes, you know that when you met Jerry the other night. Answer me. Jerry!. Yes, you know that , Yes, George has caused quite a stir in the amateur tennis community recently when,,,,,,, he has caused quite a stir in the amateur tennis players union. Do you know anything about such a person? If you do know,, answer me.... Yes, I know a great name for a tennis player .... Yes, I know just like Jerry Seinfeld.... And I would love to have a little connection, maybe a personal connection, with George. Do you know much about this person or is this just some person selling drugs?.
GEORGE: ( laughing) Sh-- .. So, yeah, it certainly is.
JERRY: But that's not all. Do you know that Schindler's List was in progress some forty years ago today?
GEORGE: No, I think I have it all.
JERRY
====================
JERRY: You know what I am talking about?! What the hell...? Elaine, you let him have a pet because... (Jerry slowly makes his way toward her. Elaine is slightly flirtatious, Jerry is not).Actual girlfriend: It is such an unfathomable problem for me.Thanks! (turns and leaves. Jerry is not amused.) Anyway... Where you going, why don't you take a little trip?
JERRY: I was going to give it a try.
ELAINE: Why... (goes to leave. Jerry finds something that would intrigue her.)
JERRY: Hi. You know, Nina, you'll never guess what's happened to me. I... (idk) What?
ELAINE: You know, I feel a little off.
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: I, I feel a little off.
JERRY: You know, shallow, um...
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: I think you're off.
ELAINE: What? What?
JERRY: I think you're off.
ELAINE: I got this sign for Olive guy...
JERRY: Olive guy! Olive guy, college gum...
ELAINE: No! You got that. Why don't you try another one?
JERRY: I've tried them all. I don't think they match up with mine.
ELAINE: Oh. That's too bad.
JERRY: Ok. (leaves. Jerry looks at his watch, it's four:  Don't quit, it's six:  What do you need to do now?...)
JERRY: Ah.
KRAMER: Empty your pockets.
JERRY: Don't panic.
KRAMER: Alright, get in there. Quick as pie, but legless
====================
JERRY: I can't believe this. Lydia. Your father has a lot of auditions.
JERRY: Oh. And he's got a couple of really bad ones. Look, look, I'm going to psyche myself into it, Jerry. The more references I've made in the past twenty minutes, the funnier. It's a girl's play, you got to go funnier than that. (Elaine enters.)
JERRY: Hey.
ELAINE: Hi.
JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: How are you?
ELAINE: Hi, how are you?
JERRY: I just came from L.A. This is some kinda hilly area. I got to get on a special little Rickshaw.
ELAINE: So, how do you act with your mother?
JERRY: Oh, I guess I just follow the rules. sex, swearing, everything.
ELAINE: Oh, well, aren't you the type to swear? Do you do that?
JERRY: Oh, yeah, sure. I'm sort of a poly. swearing, everyone does.
ELAINE: Oh, you know her cliques me? Lenny, Ethel, Susan. Ethel's always swearing.
ELAINE: Ethel's in a lot of ways exactly like Ethel Merman, fr... See ya.
JERRY: See ya.
ELAINE: No, we're going out tonight, right?
JERRY: Yeah, y... we do have a little problem.
ELAINE: Mmm, mmm. (hugs Jerry.)
JERRY: You're not Ethel Merman, are you?
ELAINE: Not yet.
KRAMER: Well, what about Lenny? Did you ever notice? The low regard for someone's body that
====================
JERRY: I had bet I was on Kruger, I bet you on Kruger. Do the G.O.P. folks know?
ELAINE: They must have had a story.
KEITH: I've been in the news this morning. About the new medical cure for cancer, something about the new look in terms of cash. You know, in a word, cash. Plus, women.
ELAINE: How did you know?
KEITH: I think I've always loved men. I love shopping. Shopping is the new sex. You know, you're in the store, but you're really in the clear, so you know where the drain is and the sex is flowing.
ELAINE: I guess because shopping is so mobile, it's very difficult to get a hold of a store stall.
KEITH: (looting their excuse) We just caught a plane.
ELAINE: Did you see that? (smiling) I thought they were robbing you.
KEITH: No one was robbing me.
ELAINE: This avoids you.
KEITH: (crumpling a piece of dough) See that's good?
ELAINE: Yeah.
KEITH: (thumps hand against the drain) Come on.
ELAINE: Ahh! (keeps repeating) This is a tough place.
KEITH: (sphincter sells donuts)
ELAINE: How much did you get donut?
KEITH: Uh, 200-ish.
ELAINE: 200-ish? You're selling donuts?
KEITH: They're made in the United States.
ELAINE: You can't get pizza donuts in the United States. Since when does a pizza donut cost more than a donut?
KEITH: They're made in the United States.
ELAINE: Are you
====================
JERRY: (Sneezes) That guy's a scam artist. You're your real friend.
JERRY: My original friend?
NEWMAN: yeah Okay. The dentist.
JERRY: (Patting Kramer on his back) So who's talking to me?
NEWMAN: Well Newman actually he uh (Struggles to speak, even with his eyes) was speaking with Elaine.
KRAMER: (Yelling out) That person didn't say hello!
ELAINE: What were you saying!
NEWMAN: Hey Elaine if that is not good enough for you stay!
KRAMER: "Good"? "Can I have a bite?..."You wanna order Newman?..."I'm not your boyfriend..."
NEWMAN: You're not your boyfriend!!
KRAMER: You're my friend Elaine! (Jerry's still waiting, Newman's expression has changed.)
NEWMAN: Well what about Newman? (Phone rings, he answers it.)
KRAMER: Hi Newman.
NEWMAN: You're my new M.D. It's Newman Place!. I'm talking to you like Joe A. Colby.
KRAMER: Colby for Jerry!
NEWMAN: Colby for Jerry! (Kramer and Newman both laughing.)
NEWMAN: Now look, how does he know you?
KRAMER: He's got a big meeting...
NEWMAN: Of your lifetime and responsible adult behavior rule! (Kramer sneezes, knocked over a chair, and falls on it.) (George and Mr. Steinbrenner, dining at the restaurant)
GEORGE: Don't have to take a stool out in public in the middle of the street!
MR. STEINBRENNER: You won't regret this. The Chinese food.. (Costanza says, "That's mine..")
GEORGE: Will you stop it.
====================
JERRY: Yeah, I think it's the same thing.
GEORGE: Hey, maybe we should call it in French.
ELAINE: Nah, don't watch your language. George Opens the door and Jerry Looks in the door hoping that will spark a conversation.
JERRY: Well we were talking about this other day, how we'd like to keep things quiet. Just a maid, sitting on the sofa and making sarcastic faces, shut up George. Lao pulls at a loose George.
JERRY: What happened?
ELAINE: Jerry (OC) I'm back. I didn't do the move on purpose. I slipped and broke my ankle.
JERRY: Where did you fall?
ELAINE: On the sofa.
JERRY: You know, as fun as it might seem to be, to tell you the truth, I've never done a waist thing like this before. I guess because of the way he attaches to it. Armpit, back, skipping, wide hips, tucked ass, oh these are the guys that look up to me. They're guys like you who go begging and beg. They live for it. They're tough, persistent, like seals.
ELAINE: Maybe it's because I wear those three pretty squares on my chest.
JERRY: Is it because I'm a complete wuss?
ELAINE: No, but maybe she's got a point.
JERRY: Hey, maybe it's because I've been telling Frank I need more time, that he thinks I need more time.
ELAINE: What? He thought I needed more time? He tricked me.
ELAINE: Well, that's the most I can say.
JERRY: Frank's a wuss.
ELAINE: Alright, well, take it easy.
JERRY: Frank, you're cracking
====================
JERRY: They likely just wanted to make a laughingstock.
ELAINE: Yeah, we know.
ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I've seen them.
GLENN: Oh, Kramer doesn't wear sweatpants.
KRAMER: Yeah, he doesn't wear sweatpants. Well, he's supposed to. And frankly, this is something that just doesn't happen.
ELAINE: Kramer doesn't know, He's a mailman. Oh? Those pants. I mean he never buys them. Why would Kramer have any trouble at all? Aren't these his pants?
KRAMER: No, these are his - (indicates Puddy's pants) - "must-have" clothes.
ELAINE: Uh, well that's doubtful. He only buys them for me, he doesn't even think about them.
JERRY: Would you, tell him?
KRAMER: Yes, sir. I forgot all about it. We're going to the Costanza Shop on Columbus Avenue. You wanna buy a pair of jeans? Come on down. (Kramer leaps to his feet and heads for the Costanza Shop)
ELAINE: See now, it's only Sunday time. But I got this business.
JERRY: How do you get your jeans downtown?
KRAMER: It all starts with a little shopping. Grab a pair of high-end button-down blazers and walk on and (indicates the clothes) use your fingers to drag those jeans across the street.
ELAINE: (worried) What? What?
KRAMER: When I was a kid, my father always brought some to get drunk. He used to send some to his friends and when they started to go to game, he always throws them out into the street.
ELAINE: (worried) Why can't
====================
JERRY: Hi I took care of the mail anyway. Would you mind opening the mail case for me and your mother, if we're guests? Would you?
KRAMER: Look, your mother and I are going *away* now.
JERRY: Now we can do this in a way that's not embarrassing for your mother?
KRAMER: What, no smoking?
ELAINE: Hey, do you ever lie to a girl?
JERRY: Oh, like this woman dropping off Agnes from Middleburg with a blown back!
JERRY: (stares at Bania again) I know I do! Sometimes you lie to someone and tell them they're too lazy to pick up the check. Other times you just lie to someone and lie!
KRAMER: But she wants the money, Jerry! She couldn't for the femme! She had it, she had it, she had it, she had it. She's going *out*! There's another knock at the door
KRAMER: Sh, that's me. Hey, look who's here. That's Elaine. Boy, I really did it. I *really* did it. Sh, just a minute, wanna show people who think I'm *Elaine*?! Jerry opens the door
JERRY: Hey, Elaine's here. She had to leave the store, she had to leave the *mail*. There was a big stain on the front...
ELAINE: Front?! Where's the front *mail*?!
JERRY: Oh, don't believe what you're reading. There's a lot of dust up there, it *is* real *ironic* destroy!
ELAINE: Hey, I have bought thousands of clothes, and they didn't come with the label saying, "Pressure points: made from tough love". Did you know that? "Pressure points
====================
JERRY: He's struttin' around like an angel.
ELAINE: Did you have a toast?
JERRY: No. Did you have a nut?
ELAINE: No. Was it a banana?
GEORGE: On toast?
ELAINE: Oh, no. No. No. No. I wanted a piece of toast...
GEORGE: What the hell is that, a piece of toast?!
JERRY: She was gonna want a piece of toast...
KRAMER: Seriously, seriously.
JERRY: Are we almost there?
ELAINE: Yeah. A couple of blocks. Elaine is walking down the street. The camera gets very close to her as if it has some kind of camera of some kind. It is like it is coming out of the nose of a car. It stops right before hitting them. A gunshot sounds! People are walking around and some are running up the street. It's raining. Jerry's car starts to bear stuff covered the windshield.
ELAINE: People. You know that water's killing me.
JERRY: Hey, you can drive that car yourself if you want. It can hold the water.
ELAINE: Oh, no no. No. No. It's not me. I can't walk into that car with somebody in it. We all start to sing. Putumayo.
JERRY: Bally.
BABS-LOPPED!!! Jerry and Kramer are on the verge of getting out of their car.
JERRY: Don't! Driver Phita?
PHI: Jerry, wouldn't it be nice if you could drive me someplace else, this is the yogurt is O.K.?
JERRY: I sang while I was in the coma. See, the kid doesn't even know there's a doctor in the plane!
PH
====================
JERRY: Jayne Mansfield, did you unto a man?
GEORGE: Uh, no, although there may have been some one unfortunate misjudge.
ELAINE: As you would say.
GEORGE: It was an unfortunate misjudge! ( leaping over the counter ) Jerry and Kramer behind the counter.
JERRY: What are you doing here?
KRAMER: I'm having a here-and-talk.
JERRY: You call here now?
KRAMER: Say I call here now, I will enforce the order. Kramer leaves, and the store owner comes and finds Jerry.
OWNER: Hi.
ELAINE: Hi.
MAN: Hey -hey, did you hear this?-
ELAINE: Hi.
MAN: I just noticed...
ELAINE: What?
MAN: Nobody likes it here.
ELAINE: What are you talking about?
MAN: Hey, I just noticed you threw out your car keys! Are keys locked in here? You can't give your keys - keys are in here! Now, you want me to turn this light on? Here, lets look... Kramer going in the back of a car...
KRAMER: Have you noticed they look a bit more real - they're kinda jumpin'?...
GEORGE: Better looking? Kosovitz?
GEORGE: Where's Bania making his car?
KRAMER: Now, people look up to me. They go to my house and bust it up. Now this is tougher.
GEORGE: And it's only a couple of houses away, where are you?
KRAMER: I'm the guy home.
GEORGE: Down, yeah.
KRAMER: That's your second face-off on the matter of the season. You ever done anything?
GEORGE: Hey. Vodka.

====================
JERRY: How 'bout this? You cut the glue off, and you don't move the top of the container, folks, you get the picture. Imagine, every time you move the top of the container, you have a new mold at the end. It's like a C-3PO at the end, next to nothing. Unless you know when it's coming and when it's going to exit so you know where it's going and you stop whatever is going on. Now it's much more organized.
JERRY: More organized, much more organized. Where's your ruler? Where's the ruler?!
KRAMER: I don't take my boots on the trails. Eccentric, I love my boots. But I gotta figure out a way to 50 bucks an' keep getting up and running if I wanna get out of town.
JERRY: You wanna ride the bus? I'll get a coaster or something.
KRAMER: No. It's an hour over, forty-five minutes. Cool.
JERRY: You wanna dip your head in a loonie?
KRAMER: Nah.
JERRY: I said, you'll never let that thing get to you.
KRAMER: Why not?
JERRY: Nah, it's not interested in the loonie stuff.
KRAMER: It has to do with the loonie stuff, Jerry. I don't care much for the stupid little travel bags and stationary with the hors d'oeuvre.
JERRY: How d'you get rid of that?
KRAMER: Well I d'you can do it, I got a lot of friends over at Peterman's you wouldn't want to miss out on a big party if that's what you want.
JERRY: And don't drive, get rid of your friends from Outer Space and stuff.
KRAM
====================
JERRY: bald.
NINA: It's...
KRAMER: No, it's not true. It's not true.
NINA: All right, we've discussed this before...
JERRY: Yeah, what about me?
PETERMAN: Because of you.
NINA: No, no, no, no. I'm not dating anyone.
PETERMAN: Nobody.
NINA: Ooh, I'm hypoallergenic.
PETERMAN: So you'll have a good time.
NINA: I don't care.
PETERMAN: I know how to do this. (to Elaine) You'll think of something.
ELAINE: So, was the pop?
JERRY: The pop!
ELAINE: What pop?
KRAMER: Oh, like it's some kind of a joke. No, it isn't! (the coffee shop) Pinter and Newman are on the verge of signing the papers. There is a woman at the register signing.
PAULA: Signed here, Paula.
PAULA: Oh. Well thank you very much. (she left)
JERRY: See you later.
PAULA: Bye-bye. Elaine walks away, leaving Jerry looking comically surprised and delighted at the prospect of a happy medium and the fact that neither Jerry nor Elaine tastes anything so good after all these years. (Apartment Building) Elaine is in the hallway of her apartment. Kramer emerges from under the covers to confront her. Kramer has a newspaper on his mailman table. Elaine is wide-eyed and looking disdainfully at Kramer.
KRAMER: Hey.
ELAINE: Hey. Kramer darts past, leaving Jerry aiming his newspaper at Elaine's open mouth. (George's Office) George sits in his chair. He peers round George's chair to see if Christie is still working
====================
JERRY: You just ask questions.
GEORGE: He really wants to know how the waitress reacted to the break-up.
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Look who's here.
JERRY: She is?
JERRY: Well, not who she is, but quite frankly, I don't know if I can call her without him being offended. (indicates glasses) Excuse me, (indicates poster) just what do you think the waitresses are wearing for the seats?
GEORGE: You think the waitresses are wearing the seats?
JERRY: What do you know? They got ripped in the third row.
GEORGE: You think? She's got seats in the row behind the rowan.
JERRY: Standstill?
GEORGE: They're getting ripped?
JERRY: Too late! She's got seats in the row behind the rowan. They're already in the row.
GEORGE: Should we hurry? They got ripped! (the three men simultaneously jump up and down) It's not enough just to sit there. You gotta put your head above the other three guys, too.
JERRY: So just finish. (the three men simultaneously jump up and down) We're good? (the three men simultaneously jump up and down) We're good!
GEORGE: Well, why don't we just put our heads down? Let's put our heads down. Tell them to put their heads on the floor. Drop a baseball.
JERRY: I suppose basketball is a bit too involved. Skiing, ice skating, ping-pong. Why don't we just put our heads up? Let's put our heads down! (singing) Pop music? Nah, no use. Forget it.
GEORGE: I really think the waitresses have done an unappealing job in this scene. The waitress, sitting
====================
JERRY: Well, I don't hear twice, so we're really just put-offs.
ELAINE: Well, if you really had a rickshaw, you'd hurl it right out of the sky.
JERRY: Hey, have you ever seen one?
KRAMER: No. All my life, I've dreamed of putting one up on this parking lot.
ELAINE: Oh. That's true. Certainly does. Elaine looks shell-shocked.
ELAINE: Alright, gimme a break. Any dinner that's sitting right here?
JERRY: Yeah. Lemme just look through your travelodge book and there, (looks inside and opens it to a page) you'll see what I'm looking at? Nothin' much longer.
ELAINE: Well, ahem, if you're just looking for companies and people that have been around long enough, (indicates the table and laughter) you can probably check it out. (looks through the top half of the magazine and finds a picture of Jerry and his bride, dressed up. She smiles. Jerry laughs and Elaine smiles back. A little embarrassed by the nudity, he traces his lines across her features) Here. You like her? Huh? Let me see. (looks through the magazine and sees the picture of her, sees the laugh out loud. He smiles, but her smile disappears. Then she laughs again, then you laugh, then I... see her... Jerry and Elaine are in the kitchen. Jerry is trying to make some toast and his head comes back blue.
KRAMER: They're you! I saw it! (looks back to the picture) Oh yeah, I saw it! (takes a sip of the hot coffee) I didn't have the hang of it, I just .. (looks back at Kramer)
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.
====================
JERRY: Well, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have done this.
ELAINE: Ooh! (runs to the kitchen) I ran to the bathroom. (Jerry's Apartment/Elaine's Apartment)
ELAINE: It's not really necessary, but I do it more often than you think. Not because it's mine (Elaine's jealousy causes her to throw up), but because of how I perceived the Nicole we went out with, not because of the flash-backs you've seen of me with you in the past five years.
NEWMAN: Ooh.
ELAINE: HeJ, hey it's not the ooh that bothers you, Buh-bye. (she swims to Jerry's couch)
NEWMAN: Ooh, please. I want you to come around here and fix me up with my new clothes. (Jerry rushes to fix up with Newman)
ELAINE: Well you don't look too comfortable, do you?
NEWMAN: Ladies, please.
JERRY: I am extremely sorry, Elaine. (Elaine gets out, confronting Newman. He recognises him)
NEWMAN: Who's aren't they, Seinfelds? They look exactly like me.
JERRY: You know if I can't recognise the ones I recognise just try as I might to make myself recognisable I would be very interested in the record producer, one I might not know about, but to tell you the least I would be delighted to. (Newman is without characteristically camp)
NEWMAN: Very good, pleasure (gleeful laughter) ...and very much you are well pleased my friend.
JERRY: Was the entire thing a bit of a ruse?
NEWMAN: Yes a bit of a ruse I think you may have. The thing is you always know when you're being worked, you know when
====================
JERRY: Stop it..
GEORGE: I didn't mean to hurt you, I mean I wasn't trying to hurt you.
JERRY: Look , you're not getting away with this. Elaine ooze juice and dirt . auff livre , that's what you do. Kramer. That's the best disinfectant.
JERRY: Well I couldn't do anything about that Rabbi, I couldn't apply it to them.
KRAMER: Take your time , take your time you stinky bastard , take your time you're stinky bastard , because some day you'll learn to live with its horrendous negative effects and you'll come out on top. Or you can take the fight to the police and do what you want but the police won't do , you coward.
ELAINE: Do y' know what time this starts.
KRAMER: (lighting his cigar) Fifteen minutes.
JERRY: Five minutes?
ELAINE: Um hm.
KRAMER: Well ,here's the book. (stands book in hand)
ELAINE: Y'know , Beth Stavros took my book and she never gave it to me.
JERRY: How do you know?
ELAINE: Because I've always carried memory into my life and this Kramer wants to know how memory is acquired.
JERRY: Well then you ask me... The goal is eleven hundred and eighty-two.
ELAINE: Uh...mm.
JERRY: ....and you lose.
ELAINE: Losing
JERRY: Ooohhhh
ELAINE: Yeah;) *I* lost
KRAMER: Whooooa
ELAINE: You* lose
JERRY: ...You* lose
KRAMER: What do you mean lose?
JERRY: I can't remember the last
====================
JERRY: I'm not doing that. Seventy-five years is all I'm doing it for.
KRAMER: It's nothing.
ELAINE: O.K., have a seat, we'll just cover for each other...and get some water. Turn this thing around.
KRAMER: All right. How about that nurse in the coffee shop? What's her name again?
ELAINE: Catherine? (Patting George on the back) Catherine! How 'bout somebody like me? George? Anybody know the name of the girl in the photo? I don't..?
PATTY: George?
GEORGE: Mary.
PATTY: Mary. Is there any way you could get in touch with her?
GEORGE: Well I..?
JERRY: You want our recipe? Just give it to me and I'll make it hot and cold.
PATTY: I don't want any saleswomen in here. Give it to me, okay?
GEORGE: I'm not sellin' you perfume! I'm not sellin' anyone!
PATTY: Jerry, you have a head start. Give him anything.
JERRY: No thanks, you got a problem.
PATTY: I only get one head start.
GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, how much better the name would have sounded.
PATTY: Jerry? I thought its a bad name for him.
JERRY: Anyway, that name changed eleven years ago, it, it's not a number. It's actually, it's a number number. You got eighty-one, ninety, one-eighth, two-fifties-threes?! You trying to get by with nothing?! You're out like a dirt! George and I have an a taste of envy here! Jerry, you gonna put on
====================
JERRY: I think a buffalooza would have a really funny name.
ELAINE: I'm not kidding.
JERRY: Commie, Commie. Welcome. " Commie , slang.
ELAINE: Jerry wants to go grab a bite to eat so I go over to his table to look at his menu.
JERRY: Hey, what he says that's the Rusty Bar..
ELAINE: Rusty bar! He's the Commie! I don't know what it is..
JERRY: Commie! Commie! Food truck! Well, maybe we got enough! I tell you we jump!!
ELAINE: Jerry, I told ya! ( points to a menu) George comes out of a kitchen and he's
JERRY: Hey, look, Commie, Commie. And how'd you get chosen?
GEORGE: Well, I started out as a Rusty, but I'm a regular.
JERRY: So, what did you do that first day?
GEORGE: Well, I was playing "Carcass Jack".
JERRY: A show about pirates and rock stars?
GEORGE: In fact it's a pirate opera. It's about the whole history of the world under pirate rule.
ELAINE: Alright, wanna order dinner?
ELAINE: No.
JERRY: George, you want to order dinner?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: Why don't you just ask Kramer?
GEORGE: Not good.
JERRY: Kramer is a good banker.
ELAINE: He's fine. Why don't you just come in and say hello? ... I don't know.
ELAINE: Ba-ba! All right, before we eat, I want to tell you the Commie guy.
ELAINE: Who?
J
====================
JERRY: When did you get into this relationship?
GEORGE: When--
ELAINE: Jerry took my sweater off last night. The moment I felt as if I had a new type. He seems to think this is so much better than the old.
KRAMER: I like castrated meat. Voicing my own flesh and blood.
RUDY: I don't know what this guy thinks.
JERRY: Is it my flesh and blood?
ELAINE: No.
BOSS: I think you're eating too much whale food.
JERRY: Hey, I have steak dinner every week for forty years. I want a piece every week.
BOSS: What is your definition of healthy?
JERRY: Would kill to have two pieces of each.
BOSS: You're a moron.
JERRY: Almost always.
GEORGE: Just a piece of whale food?
BOSS: Well, what is your definition of unhealthy?
JERRY: I think we have a set.
KRAMER: Mr. Bonomoff, we would really only buy and sell breast milk for that week.
JERRY: Oh, well, that's why we got tours.
KRAMER: Why? We're always on the move.
JERRY: Why don't we rent a movie?
KRAMER: There you go.
JERRY: Wait 'til we hear you're going to be busted.
KRAMER: Then we're good.
ELAINE: Why does he do that?
JERRY: That's not his fault.
ELAINE: Maybe he was acting these days.
KRAMER: You know what? I need that mohel to go with me around the camp.
GUY: Keep it up!
ELAINE: Let's go. They begin
====================
JERRY: I would like to see her.
ELAINE: Excuse me?
SALESMAN: Well, I'm going to stick my neck out, this is very awkward.
ELAINE: Excuse me again. Is this the lingerie you're using?
SALESMAN: Oh, sure. Elaine is hauling a large load onto the bus. It's getting pretty awkward.
ELAINE: (cont.) I *loathe* her!
SALESMAN: It's okay, Elaine, I didn't know you had breasts. On the wall, George is explaining to Lois that he bought the lingerie.
ELAINE: (hopeful) Oh, that is so awkward! (Restaurant) George and girlfriend Rachel have finished a meal together.
RACHEL: I'm satisfied. How about dinner?
GEORGE: Ah, let's hear sweet, sentimental... (Rachel's disappointed laugh)
RACHEL: Shut up.
GEORGE: I'm satisfied! (Monk's) Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth. Elaine looks distinctly unenthused.
ELAINE: You know, in college I took a seminar on this and I turned to the auction house for pointers.
JERRY: Boobs save the world.
ELAINE: Contest? You think this can't be a joke?
JERRY: No. It can. Behind Elaine's back, the three other guys gather round, and sitiety-hopper.
ELAINE: Ladies, unbrogging is not something you browse for. You come in the store, and you pay sixty dollar to get something.
JERRY: Just get it, and give us the gist.
ELAINE: Jerry, if you see someone in here looking for a brightly-coloured envelope, you'll just get you a stern "Cartwright's Boobs".
====================
JERRY: I mean I go around telling everybody what happened to my life because I'm obsessed with it.
JERRY: It's like washing your face. George enters
GEORGE: Hey hey hey
JERRY: I heard the car name's Newman.
GEORGE: Yeah it's Newman
JERRY: Hey what are you doing here? You know you're supposed to do your act. You don't do your act.
GEORGE: I'm supposed to meet Newman. We had lunch three floors down.
JERRY: Newman drinks coffee and cream Jerry, he's a caffeine drinker. He has a complete fixation on Jerry.
GEORGE: Just tell me what happened to my life five years ago. I'm an alcoholic now. Is that so terrible? I never would have happened if I was an alcoholic. I'm not here. George is pulling of his jacket getting the briefcase and his coat, Jerry is not listening.
GEORGE: A coffee table book about coffee tables. That is not in the book.
JERRY: Well not in this book. I need something to read.
GEORGE: So read the first half.
JERRY: Yeah the rest of the book concerned myself with being an honest person. I don't like being an alcoholic. I don't like being an honest person.
GEORGE: What could you say? You're sort of a soft drinker.
JERRY: Hard drinker than most people. I can't argue with that. Hard drinker than most people, I tell you that. Now you listen. Why? You think? Why? You're right. Why? You're right. It's a lie! All li you are talking about -- me! You're the li who the dam is. The dam -- dam! George leaves in a hurry picks up a paper and picks up a pen as George reaches for it
GEORGE
====================
JERRY: Well, I think I'll try.
ELAINE: (Susan sees George as Audrey finishes eating) Susan! Susan! (George forces Audrey to look right at him)
GEORGE: Okay, um, wait a second. I'm sorry, I can't wait for you. (George flinches, seeing Audrey behind him, he doesn't react)
GEORGE: Jerry, good night (Elaine walks in, frightened) Elaine! George! (Elaine twists around, George falls down on the couch near her)
ELAINE: Jerry! What are you doing?!
JERRY: I'm watching the fifties (Elaine begins typing furiously) - fifties.
ELAINE: Oh, look, pal, (Elaine clicks) fifties. (Elaine clicks a third time)
ELAINE: Look, I can't do this. I don't like this situation, (Elaine clicks more)
ELAINE: Okay! I'll go.
JERRY: No! Elaine can't click now!
ELAINE: Alright, I'll just try again...
ELAINE: (Kisses her hand) Hi.
JERRY: I think I can click again. (George stretches Jerry out, Jerry wins)
GEORGE: I think I'm fast. I don't have to spare a minute to get to the bathroom.
ELAINE: George, you - you need to click...
GEORGE: How can I do that? (Elaine reaches for Jerry a second time) You're too much.
JERRY: I didn't...
ELAINE: OK, because you know how to click, I - I'll just hang on to you.
KRAMER: Super. (Kramer drags Jerry out/back to the kitchen)
JERRY: Hey, what's the deal with
====================
JERRY: Hey -- Kramer.
KRAMER: HELLOY! Hi Paula.
PAULA: Hi. What're you doing here?
PAULA: I'm just waiting for my friend Morgan to show up and maybe get me another seat.
PAULA: Right Elaine, right! I'll see you later.
PAULA: George! Elaine?
GEORGE: Yeah.
PAULA: Well, I was thinking -- we're going out tomorrow night.
GEORGE: All right. So?
JERRY: So? We were planning on going to the Knick game?
GEORGE: Yeah! But, the game, by the way, was going to be cancelled.
JERRY: Really? You regret cancelling it?
GEORGE: Well, it's just one of those things where you kind of have to pull the wagon at everything. The whole effect should be: "I guess I'm never gonna make it because of this guy."
JERRY: Right. Right. Well, so, is there anything you could do?
GEORGE: Nah. Nah. I'm really busy right now.
JERRY: Really busy?
GEORGE: Yeah. Really busy.
JERRY: I-I-I know there's a possibility you're just making me work really hard.
GEORGE: Really? That's my interpretation of the song. I think it's "I'm busy working on my card." "I'm really busy working on my card. I don't even need your help because I got the other thing." I think it's "I'm busy working on that card, too." Whatever.
KRAMER: It's one of those things where you really have to be
JERRY: Yeah, like rolling up a mower. Kramer sniffs
GEORGE: You know, you really need to be and stand
====================
JERRY: Oh that's did you notice anything unusual about his appearance. His arms have become much slimmer, and he's wearing a lot more athletic wear.
HELEN: Or maybe he's just taller, as in, uh, uh... He looks... well, I don't know. But, uh...
MORTY: What? Well, it's more of a boy's trip out to the fields, and boy's out to take a walk.
JERRY: Uh, what about your vitamin D3, alright? I got this idea.
MORTY: Jerry, this is something I can do, I got this idea that everybody in the country can do.
JERRY: Okay.
HELEN: When you bring a friend, you tell them how much you love them, that's how long you've been in this life. It's not like if you killed somebody, you tell them that and say, "That is the man I'm looking for, that's the man I can talk to about that."
MORTY: Then you put it in the mail, and everyone will know how much I love them.
JERRY: It is very powerful.
MORTY: Of course. People open mail, they open it like they don't want to face the roots. Jerry, I got to tell you something, I never said this before that I'd do it again, but I really think it captures this age old trick.
HELEN: How could this trick have survived the Industrial Revolution?
MORTY: Nobody knows, it's very bizarre.
HELEN: Maybe the earth was round for millions of years.
MORTY: Maybe.
HELEN: Here we are, people, people liars.
MORTY: I can tell you that. You would not believe what we're through with this thing.
HELEN:
====================
JERRY: Ow, c'mon.
KRAMER: Get out! I don't even know you.
JERRY: Listen, if this is your son, allow me to under my breath.
KRAMER: What's your son doing?
JERRY: This is Jerry.
JERRY: Look, I'm the one who should have called NBC because they caved and they didn't want anybody watching. Now you're talking.
MEL: Jerry, c'mon, why did we let you see his Nest?
JERRY: Preys on the little kid. You know that, I'm just a kid. Some motherfucker doesn't want to watch a movie when her daughter-in-law wants to watch a movie.
MEL: I'm sorry Jerry, we're gonna go. I can't take this.
KRAMER: (answering phone) Hello.
MEL: Jerry Seinfeld is on the phone.
JERRY: Hi. (it should be answered.)
KRAMER: (on the phone) Aw, he's dead. (George enters)
KRAMER: (sitting beside Jerry) I'm sorry but my friend said he'd be watching tomorrow night's show.
JERRY: My poor kid couldn't go to the tomorrow night show.
KRAMER: You can't have a kid on a plane who's been through enough.
MEL: Who are you to decide that this is not going to be a good TV viewing experience?
JERRY: The pilot's pretty funny.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, the acting is second to none.
JERRY: I'm glad we had the front-runner.
KRAMER: Uh, wait a minute, pal. Don't we have a little problem that Kramer's acting a little weird lately?
JERRY:
====================
JERRY: We made a deal.
GEORGE: You two keep the cigars and the condiments separate. This is very complicated.
JERRY: And you just did business with me.
GEORGE: You know, I'm very comfortable with cigars in every way.
JERRY: I still don't see why you wouldn't.
GEORGE: This deal's all but broke.
JERRY: So she approaches you with one of those big cigar palms. George is about to approve, when a thought occurs to him.
JERRY: Mmm, is that tough being shot? Nah. He dives to the floor and heaves the contents over Jerry's head, and then plunges his hand into the back of Jerry's head.
JERRY: Get out. (Waves his stick like it's cannonballs) George laughs hysterically. Jerry stands, staring in disbelief at the sight of George's cigar-smoking cigar minder. (George's Apartment)
MORTY: So Jerry, I've had it with you. I keep all my appointments private. In fact, I spent five minutes with him today telling him I didn't want to talk. Obviously he knows how to manage a payboard, but he doesn't need help.
JERRY: What payboard?
MORTY: Forgetting about Jerry. He ran out of air for a few feet...
JERRY: Is that rampart?
MORTY: Yeah. It's for my father...
JERRY: My...
MORTY: Anyway, I'm really enjoying spending time with you, but something might be causing a bit of a stir - the funeral. Do you mind if I watch a briefcase here?
MORTY: Briefcases?
JERRY: Yeah, briefcases are very special. This guy could only carry a couple of briefcases. It sits on stand
====================
JERRY: No. Erika comes in.
ELAINE: Look at that face! She's gorgeous.
JERRY: Are you okay, Elaine? I had to disabuse myself of my piddle about Paella.
ELAINE: Hey, I am not disabuse myself of my piddle. You know, maybe my mother made me think I'm not that attractive, 'cause according to your mother, she gave me a go-ahead in part because I wear black today.
JERRY: I don't know anything about her daily habits. Maybe she does these things because she's unhappy. Anyway...
ELAINE: So, now I'm going to get a clean break. She might show up again, and I won't have any choice but to live with my guilt.
JERRY: With all due respect, I admit I admit to something, but I'm still a *charlatan*.
ELAINE: You know, I happen to know one time when Kramer and I were living in Queens Beach, and we parks commissioner was visiting her, and she brought her with it.
JERRY: Oh really? Because, wha...?
ELAINE: Well, so, I went in there with my shotgun. When I came out in the hall, I found my belt and a drink of some sort... (another pause) Oh, oh, hi, Elaine. Yeah, I called the liquor store to see if I could get them to drop me some Kramer. I said, "Sure, sure, what about these lines?"
JERRY: What lines?
ELAINE: Uh. Ah. You know what? I called some stores and they brought me one of these, twenty dollars. (Kramer is on the other end of the phone)
KRAMER: Estelle, come on over give me that line.
ESTELLE: Uh, would you just
====================
JERRY Why couldn't they do that?
GEORGE: Well I don't know, they might have an easier time getting back here. They wouldn't mind if they were, you know look, in a hurry.
JERRY: Del Boca Vista.
GEORGE: Are you kidding me? I went to that bar run by Carl and his wife. Oh, they're musicians, they wrote, they play, they flute. Yeah, they never play again, I guess I got a sick enough burn.
JERRY: Well they certainly don't want us there.
GEORGE: I don't know why they have to jam with that much wood. All right, I've got to go find a new place to sleep.
JERRY: Where's Elaine?
RITA: I don't know. Coney Island?
JERRY: Yeah, she'll waken up.
GEORGE: Where's Elaine?
RITA: We don't know.
GEORGE: Really? Why?
JERRY: Yes we do. Elaine's in a bad mood. She's got a boyfriend row, gone, I don't know what I saw. She's in a sanitarium.
GEORGE: Really? What is going on here? I.. found out that..
JERRY: Alright I don't know.. but before you and I can make any decision regarding our future, we've got to learn more about you.
GEORGE: That's not very sensitive.
JERRY: That's not sensitive. George sits down picks up his umbrella, then reaches under his desk drawer for something under the desk.
GEORGE: I wanna. Emily emerges from under her desk with a pencil and pad. She motions for Jerry to stay away from the pencil; he does.
GEORGE: Okay.. (TO ELAINE) Have you seen the paper yet? Tell
====================
JERRY: You mean, sittin' at the table?
GEORGE: Well, I happen to have a very high fantasy clientele.
JERRY: High fantasy?
GEORGE: Well, if you put me on a tab, that might not be as bad if you're ...
ELAINE: You're not my type?
JERRY: Oh, I guess ... but that kind of falls under your umbrella ...
ELAINE: Okay ... (door buzzer) Yeah?
GEORGE: (Kramer enters) Listen, you got any meat?
ELAINE: I'll speak to you later.
JERRY: Okay, I'll see you later.
GEORGE: (Out comes Elaine) She wanted to see me, and here I am smitten with a type A guy.
ELAINE: Nice man, huh? Kramer, from Manhattan, just gave me a type I a.
KRAMER: Give me a man.
ELAINE: You're getting type A. You're getting a man.
JERRY: He's extremely handsome.
ELAINE: Just tell him it's a man.
GEORGE: (Kramer walks in) Kramer, gimme your wallet.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, Yeah,Yeah. I'll see you later.
ELAINE: (To George) Oh, okay. Come on, let's go.
KRAMER: Could you wait until we go to the movies?
GEORGE: Alright, let's go, okay.
ELAINE: George's in the park, he doesn't want to come.
KRAMER: Alright. (leaves)
GEORGE: (on the street, holding newspaper) Stay home.
ELAINE: Okay, alright. I'll see you later. (he leaves)
KRAMER: Wait,
====================
JERRY: He is finding a psychiatrist. They are trying to save his life. Yeah, with all due respect, psychiatrists are really not that good people.
GEORGE: (always a touch tied up in his own thoughts) I think he's going for a third marriage. What?! The guy has been with a fourth wife for YEARS.. anyone can do this!
JERRY: A fourth wife?!
GEORGE: (teary laugh) I think she did.
JERRY: But she can't break up with you.
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: because you're a fruit.
GEORGE: who isn't? just a fruit?
JERRY: (smiles)
GEORGE: (also suddenly eating a peach) just like that.
JERRY: (sarcasm) Yeah, like that's the rules of marriage. No laughs, no treats. And you know what these people in these apartments they're swearing off each other, because of this guy? ..You promised I'd keep you in your hotel room, because I got four nights in a row or something.
GEORGE: Four nights in a Ritzy? That's it?
JERRY: No kidding.
GEORGE: Aw, c'mon man!
KRAMER: No, I gotta go.
JERRY: But you promised me this.
KRAMER: Oh yeah, I don't remember that part.
JERRY: No kidding.
KRAMER: Well, okay. (pulls out a wine list) I dunno where this comes from, (suggestive) you know where it comes from? (Elaine enters).
JERRY: (to Elaine) Hey.
ELAINE: Hey. Five-thirty in the morning? Get out.
JERRY: Jerry, we're going on a five-th
====================
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: Keys.
JERRY: What for?
ELAINE: I told you.
JERRY: This is a pretty good scene, Elaine. Could you do me a favor?
ELAINE: I gotta find a new place to stop and talk...maybe Soda.
ELAINE: Oh, would that be okay if I just called Kramer? (caused a minor ruckus at the Chinese waitress)
JERRY: Hmm. Very good. Thanks again.
ELAINE: How 'bout those Chardonnay bottles? I like Soda bottles.
JERRY: Oh. Alright. Thanks again.
ELAINE: Jerry, where is this guy? I need more Champagne!
JERRY: Oh! Won't he...he just called back?
ELAINE: Alright, we'll talk later.
GEORGE: You know why won't you just meet with him?
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Because it's the Champagne! Jerry's Home - Kramer enters
KRAMER: Newman!! Hi! Donna! Hi! And you!
JERRY: I had it with me. Hello!
KRAMER: Well I just came from the movies.
JERRY: Let me ask you a question.
KRAMER: Come on, what did you just see?
JERRY: Any traditional Chinese delicacies?
KRAMER: Ah! I'm not religious.
ELAINE: You're not who you think you are, are you?
JERRY: Hey, I was gone for two days straight. Are you out of your mind?
KRAMER: what?
JERRY: Je... ka... ka! You go, take a walk with me or do your thing.
KRAMER: I thought I was going to
====================
JERRY: yes. Well... Kramer refuses to move. Jerry begins rocking the table back and forth, Kramer's head resting on Jerry's chest.
KRAMER: What'd you do?
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Love shot! (George is pulling a face at me, There's a street sweeper.) New scene - Elaine and Jerry in Jerry's apartment, he's moving the couch back and forth a few paces, before rattling off a story about how they moved back in with the couch.
JERRY: Did you call Tim Whatley?
ELAINE: Nope. But he's very funny. I laugh, I forget to laugh.
JERRY: So you don't know anything, or at least you didn't expect it to.
ELAINE: Not really.
JERRY: Well, he's good, I'm not exactly sure. But it's a funny story behind my back. New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment trying to figure out what's going on.
JERRY: So you're in the back?
ELAINE: Well, it's first time I've seen Elaine in a cowboy outfit this late in the season. And it seems unlikely, to me, that ever happen. New scene - George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment trying to figure out what's going on.
ELAINE: Hey, tell me what happened.
GEORGE: So we're having dinner.
ELAINE: Why?
GEORGE: I'm going to. (A loud knock is heard at the door.)
JERRY: What is going on out here?
GEORGE: I'm not here.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: I'm the judge.
ELAINE: Uh, excuse me, uh, what are you doing?
GEORGE: Oh, I got a date
====================
JERRY: Too bad. I never kissed a man. (Kramer, standing with a group of people, is holding a pool cue) For all you know, the difference between a healthy swim and a shark attack is about nothing. (Goes to leave, but leaves a group photo with Jerry on his arm)
JERRY: I don't have a pool, so I called the guy who designed mine in for the punchline.
MRS HAMILTON: That is so juvenile. Love the guy.
ELAINE: I'm in a mood for something. (Rushes out of Jerry's room, followed by George)
GEORGE: So, uh...was this about George or did you call me?
GEORGE: I just admiring his suit.
MR HAMILTON: You call me, I don't call you.
GEORGE: Oh, did you call me sir?
MR HAMILTON: I'm just quoting your mother--quite literally. 'Dear mother, I knew you'd like a piece of me--I'm your moment for the taking.' Anyway, I'm really enjoying spending time with you, and I just missed the cold weather play in the hall with you last night.
GEORGE: Really? Honestly, really pleased.
MR HAMILTON: That is correct. Thank you. (Goes back out the door, but leaves another group of people waiting to see if Mr Wilhelm can find his pool cue.) Jerry, what do you do here?
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry and Susan got engaged last night.
JERRY: Oh my god, they're getting married.
KRAMER: Yeah. Well, the kids are gonna be little ones.
JERRY: Yeah. Kramer you keep track of all that?
KRAMER: Oh, I keep track of all that. Well I started reading it last week.
JERRY: Oh
====================
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: We're running our own errand, Jimmy wants to see you.
JERRY: Um, I think I remember.
KRAMER: Uh, well, well, yeah, yeah, ok, JR's errand, and uh, we'll see ya.
JERRY: Ok.
KRAMER: Sure. (Walks off)
JERRY: All right! You wanna get out of here?
GEORGE: You know what? That's about it. You went out on a couple of dates with this girl? You have no idea how sick people are.
GEORGE: I smashed her eardrum. It was like a full-grown fruit.
KRAMER: You know, the first time we ever went out, it was like dinner. We ended up going out for dinner.
GEORGE: How quickly you go from all of those dates getting cancelled, to nothing.
KRAMER: Well, we don't want to do that now, we know the dinners.
GEORGE: Well, how quickly do you have to know?
KRAMER: Well, I live with my aunt. ... WE WERE NINE
KRAMER: Really?
GEORGE: Really???
KRAMER: Yeah,
GEORGE: We met in a parking garage.
GEORGE: What?
KRAMER: I said, I saw Paul Simon ... He's the new director of the Tubby Mies Tea Shop.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, ... we met ... Tubby!
JERRY: Would you tell me if you were bitten?
JERRY: Seeming to have recovered, I concluded from his bites that it was a bite from a moleskin jacket by a woman, that he was mutilating grasshoppers. ... So I got a little paranoid.
ELAINE
====================
JERRY: Yeah, the raisins. You got the raisins?
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah, of course. The raisins are the brain.
ELAINE: Hmm. Ooh.
JERRY: (evasive) Hey.
WOMAN: A fifty dollar bill?
JERRY: It's a hundred and twenty.
ELAINE: You don't mean anything by it.
JERRY: I can't believe I don't know what you mean.
ELAINE: Well, you're not the only one.
JERRY: Will you stop it for me. Aren't you tired of fightin' and hungry?
WOMAN: Right.
JERRY: I would just like to get my wallet, I mean I haven't felt that whole bag myself.
WOMAN: I tuna all the time.
JERRY: C'mon please.
WOMAN: How would you like to get your tuna?
JERRY: I don't think all the time?
ELAINE: Hey, I am never eatin' you ever. You're a moron.
WOMAN: I thought you said anything about getting there...
JERRY: You think I get that? I know you do.
KRAMER: What?
ELAINE: How the hell do I know? How can I know?
KRAMER: You liked his sneakers.
ELAINE: I did not. How could I know?
KRAMER: You looked very familiar.
ELAINE: I wore sneakers all the time.
KRAMER: I had the same look.
ELAINE: I thought you looked quite familiar.
KRAMER: I did not.
JERRY: I think I may have overdid it.
K
====================
JERRY: And you figure they could use him, it doesn't really put him in a very good position.
ELAINE: Even in the short run, it's not going to make a huge difference.
JERRY: Oh I see. So you can't really beat 'em - so you lose.
ELAINE: (While opening a bottle of wine) Well, if 'em could beat us, we'd be friends.
JERRY: Oh yeah, that's true, but.. so what.
ELAINE: Help! Someone help! (Elaine, sitting opposite Jerry, is trying to help)
ELAINE: I was just speaking with Mr. Babson today, and I tell you this, if you don't talk about it in front of him, he gets angry.
JERRY: Really?
ELAINE: Yeah, ya know.. I just remembered I had some business and I had to leave my secretary's note.
JERRY: Oh. ok.. So what happened? She called Mr. Babson twice today, and you know what he said? He called George.
ELAINE: Ah.
JERRY: Aha aaand now he's going door to door!
ELAINE: (In the arms-length, red shirt of a high school senior) Mr. Babson, (points at red shirt) go ahead! Take a look around!
KRAMER: So, Kevin and I got married.
JERRY: Bon voyage, lady. (Kramer takes the red shirt and turns it on. It works)
KRAMER: Jerry! It worked! Look at the size of this man! Look! He's all red! Duncan! I can't believe it. (pointing to the man) he's such a clever guy. Turn him inside out. (George's old girlfriend) Hey George, you
====================
JERRY: Ha! Yes, but this was before the AIDS scare. You remember, doctors don't recommend it.
ELAINE: I know, I know, why not? Let me see what I can do. I have no AIDS.
JERRY: That's it. (clockwise from top left) Four thousand. That's it! (Doris opens drawer) Four thousand. Is that enough for me?
ELAINE: Alright, doctor, you get to keep this bag!
DOCTOR: Yeah, so? I'll put it down below the table.
ELAINE: Alright, doctor, but put it down. We'll have to put it back where it was.
DOCTOR: The chest, on the bottom. (Elaine starts examining him) He thinks the chest here isn't much help. He has this strange equanimity to it all.
JERRY: Well Rudy's here, I can't go.
DOCTOR: Well Rudy's here.
JERRY: I'm glad you're here, Costanza's got me mauled.
ELAINE: So what's going on between you and Dwayne? You can't call him.
DORIS: No, no, I called David Puddy.
JERRY: Why does he need to be called now?
ELAINE: A long time ago... (Doris sits down with Elaine)
DOCTOR: I don't know if you should call him.
ELAINE: I'll call him. (Ronnie's apartment)
RONNIE: C'mon, go down there. Don't go. We're not getting to that dinner. We can't go.
ELAINE: Why not?
RONNIE: Do you want to go?
ELAINE: Why not?
RONNIE: We don't want to.
====================
JERRY: I was in the lobby.
GEORGE: Well, if you're in the lobby, I'm gonna see the guy who didn't come did I?
JERRY: My friend smells you.
GEORGE: Don't come, let him smell you. You stink.
JERRY: I don't think I can stay long in this thing.
ELAINE: Should I clean it?
JERRY: Clean it. (chases George) (No one is talking)
ELAINE: No way, I gotta get this thing cleaned. I am not going back on the car. Jerry, get the hell out of here!
JERRY: Oh, come on, Elaine. Don't go Nik!
ELAINE: No, no, don't tell this idiot you want me to get my fix of furness washed. You see this motor has been motor oiled! Jerry, please, help me! Jerry, I want the fix of furness cleaned, Nik! (Knocks on the door)
JERRY: Does this sound like your car?
ELAINE: How's the motor working?
JERRY: Well, the plate is kind of weary from riding a heat wave.
ELAINE: (Faint) Oh! Again..
JERRY: Hey, the plate is still talking.
ELAINE: Maybe you can fix it up Elaine?
JERRY: Maybe I can. You go check on the motor. (Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, how you doin'?
ELAINE: Oh, lie down, guy. I've gotta take a swim.
KRAMER: Hey, you know what? I'm going to Risk Us again tomorrow, so if you're wanna come, I'd like to get a vasectomy done the Thursday after my procedure.
JERRY: Risk Us
====================
JERRY:To end it all.
ELAINE:Well Jerry, you done with that book?
JERRY:Yeah.
ELAINE:You had it at the bookstore.
JERRY:Ah hah.
ELAINE:Well uh what else do you like?
JERRY:Well, I uh, got some other stuff though, see ya.
KRAMER: Hey, I just got those sardines back, I mixed up some of them.
ELAINE:Mm hm, ok. Kramer leaves, Elaine sees something unusual, she tries to catch it but it turns to Elaine as she passes him.
ELAINE:Ohk. There it is.
JERRY:Kramer dropped those sardines, Manish Kese at you?
ELAINE:Exactly. It happened to me, I didn't know it was a sausages.
GEORGE:By the way Elaine, tell me about this book idea I got a couple of letters to hand out.
ELAINE:Publisher's office, that's a great idea. I'm going in tomorrow, I'll give you a preview. Hey, we'll mention it to you. Hey, don't worry we won't.
GEORGE:No, but then there's that other thing they want me to mention, you know, "The Liberal Lunch". Hey Newman just mumble things and I'll mumble.
ELAINE:Oh hey, did you try the first book at a fountain pen, like a pen of some sort?
JERRY:That's a funny question.
ELAINE:Well it's a Liberal Lunch, Newman's Mr. Penske's Mr. Penske Penske is a madman, Jerry tries to kill him.
JERRY:Me neither.
ELAINE:I'm going in Jerry's car, we like to
====================
JERRY: Well, is it possible I could use your room?
KRAMER: (After Kramer) Ah yea, sure.
JERRY: Now, you better... write.
KRAMER: (Mumbles) Oh, how nice... (HELEN slips out of bed and walks to other room)
ENZO: Mr. Enzo...
JERRY: There is someone I can talk to for... a... phone. (HELEN starts talking, with Jerry)
ENZO: Yes, yes, call her... tell her to call me, oh, ... how... long (Enzo hangs up then move to read from "What is the Hell Is A Phone Got Into A Phone Book?")
JERRY: So, you don't like the book.
ENZO: Oh, maybe it is better. (Laughs coach) (Enzo stares at his phone like he's crazy)
JERRY: Again, let's call her. (Enzo sniffs his eye contact) (Jerry sniffs his eye contact) (Jerry goes to change tables but Enzo sticks his head out in the other direction)
ENZO: (Answers phone) Yes, Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: (Starts tapping away at phones) Hello, She's not there. (Clears his throat) Hang on. (Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Well, it's just a dream. (Leaning over the table, she picks up a paper) Hey, what is with that guy, you know, you're supposed to be the best tennis player in the world. (Elaine gives Jerry a look - he didn't mention his name)
KRAMER: Maybe he's not the best... Imagine his lawyer sits in his office defending a man's snooze motor. (Grabs a legal brief with his finger)
ELAINE:
====================
JERRY: I'm realizing that this is much harder to say than do.
KRAMER: You're not one to be rained out. You rock. You roll. And you fail. Now your failure is proof that you're one to fail. Seinfelds are made up. That doesn't mean they think they're perfect, it just means there's more to life than you think. You don't have to choose, you can go through hell, you suck at shopping, you trash. Kramer parks out front, Jerry follows, looking a bit spiffy at first. First he's carrying a garbage bag, later, a plastic bucket and a soda can, where he picks up whatever's on his return. Elaine sneaks out of the apartment behind Jerry and into the hallway, where she looks down and sees a suit jacket and another suit jacket with a different pocket in it.
KRAMER: (proffering) There.
ELAINE: There.
KRAMER: Yeah, so?
ELAINE: So, there you are.
KRAMER: Ehm, you too, buddy.
ELAINE: (accepting) Thank you.
KRAMER: No more catching the squirrels, ok? He settles into place.
ELAINE: Boy, those are pretty sneakers. The sneakers become part of the boot, an unhealthy association. So, what kind is this? (Electric buzz and lights go off at Jerry's apartment) OK, we entered from the street, but when we came to, there was a squirrel on top of the pizza.
KRAMER: What?
ELAINE: It had a spong-shaped head and was licking some cheese off the top of it. It looked really scared.
JERRY: So, was this a joke, a joke on you?
ELAINE: No, it's not a joke. I actually have a
====================
JERRY: I hope you move your arms a little bit back.
KRAMER: Oh, hey, you could use a blow back.
MICHAEL: A blow back?
KRAMER: Hey... (laughing)
MICHAEL: What the hell are you doing here?
KRAMER: I'm talking about my chiropractor, and I'm talking about your... Kramer..
MICHAEL: Kramer!
KRAMER: (triumph) Yeah, you're right! Yeah! We bring the best in!
MICHAEL: (cautiously) Well, that's good talking to you, because I know where they are.
KRAMER: (cautiously) yeah, (triumph) We bring the best in, by the best, and I guarantee it, Jerry. (Outside Auto shop) (Jerry's car, well over two hours late)
JERRY: O.K. I have to go to work. I'll drive home. Then see the insurance say I can't keep the car if I can't pay my auto bill.
CARL: So you're sticking with the old guys?
JERRY: I am. I am getting auto bill for the new car. Big job! (Jerry's car - very late)
JERRY: This has got into traffic.
CARL: Hey look, you can't keep the old car if you don't auto bill it.
JERRY: No I haven't paid it in... years... so... premiums... are gonna fall. (Jerry's car - close to full size)
JERRY: So how are you guys getting car bill for the car?
GEORGE: I pay in. (Jerry's car, half full)
JERRY: How many miles a car?
CARL: How many miles *are* there?
JERRY: Oh, you think?

====================
JERRY: Little women never let you go.
FRANK: I bet you were the ones who tried to kill Kramer.
KRAMER: (giggling)
KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen one of those fake breasts? I've only seen one... Ehh, an 'E', not a '..... (walks away) (Scene ends) (The Coffee shop) (Leslie is sitting alone, obviously bored)
GUY: So, how do you figure up Jerry's plans?
LESLIE: Because I've been telling him, he likes desert. Desertion, backstab, all kinds of funny euphemisms.... You know where these slides are? Is Kruger Industrial Smoothing, shrinkage, shrinkage, repeat?
KRAMER: I thought you said you were going to talk on the phone.
LESLIE: (indicating) They're in there!
KRAMER: (opening the fridge) Oh, these slides are good for ten minutes.
LESLIE: Hey. This gum could really make a comedian night! (jumping to her feet) Hey, will you pay for these slides? I got two slides!
KRAMER: I guess they are worth a thousand dollars, if I had to...
LESLIE: Take one. I will pay for that one.
KRAMER: What?
LESLIE: Hey, big gum, shrunken. You might wanna try a muffin. (to waitress) Excuse me...
GEORGE: Come on! I'll pay for these slides if you will!
JERRY: I'll pay for them!
JERRY: (apologetically) No, I know that.
KRAMER: Look, I'll be honest with you, I don't know why you're here.
JERRY: It was just some stupid,
====================
JERRY: Are you going out with him?
ELAINE: No, why?
JERRY: I, I didn't hear anything. What?
ELAINE: (Bzzz.) You were right. He was right.
JERRY: I had 'em.
ELAINE: I can have a piece of you, you can have him with me.
JERRY: Oh, I'll be right back. Kramer has obviously been through a lot. George returns with his meal.
GEORGE: What happened? Did you find out?
GEORGE: Oh yeah, I sat on the jury.
JERRY: That is not true. Someone just sat on a jury. They're all men.
GEORGE: Well, I thought we had a good chance.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Well, I think we picked a tie.
ELAINE: How did you come up with that?
GEORGE: I think we all licked our sandwiches on that horrible evening we slept at the cabin.
JERRY: Can you bring your cereal from the supermarket?
GEORGE: Please, Elaine, bring it back. Please, come with me.
ELAINE: Who is it?
GEORGE: This guy I'm seeing, this guy the guy I'm seeing, what the hell is his name. As opposed to, you know, Fields. Fields? Huh? Fields. Field. Field.
ELAINE: (Coming in slowly) Excuse me, I.. haven't heard about that.. Jerry's apartment.
JERRY: (Surprised) What?
ELAINE: (Whispering to him) After the botched botched the funeral. I think it was botched a lot.
GEORGE: Shhh. Shh! You got fired. Uh. I had to stick around all winter. Some friend of
====================
JERRY: I want to stay here..
GEORGE: Don't believe everything you hear.
JERRY: ...Back to the Super Terrific Kramer. Uhm, he's a dream to me, a dream to my mother. Oh my God, this is huge.
GEORGE: Yeah! ..She'll never believe that.
MEL: Kramer you have to get that dental tool back. 'Cause it's not gonna be any more of your business.
KRAMER: Whaddya know Bill and Kramer? They might get it back.
JERRY: Ah! yeah, if things go south.
MEL: We'll see... We'll spend the rest of the night.
JERRY: It's a great plan.
ELAINE: (Mutters to herself as Kramer enters) How ya doin'?
KRAMER: Hey. Hey, great.
ELAINE: Hello.
JERRY: Kramer, what's up?
KRAMER: No, just Loren and I were talking to him.
ELAINE: Unfortunate, but odd, that you have this much trouble getting over the phone.
KRAMER: (nervous) Hey, how ya doin'? Hey, how 'bout this? How 'bout this? You take my number, I'll send it over. Hey, how about this? Give me a hundred and I'll get in touch with you. I'll get in touch with you. And I'll get my hat and fur coat. Alright, tell me how it's gonna go.
ELAINE: I'm not going to the game. I'm gonna stay home. I'm gonna go back and forth between cities. Eventually I think I'm gonna make it but it's not to Jon Voight. It's just gonna be a memory. That's it - it's all me. All that I know
====================
JERRY: You let him do it.
GEORGE: Care?
JERRY: To give. You can't give. If you give, you can't give anything. You're not a pod.
GEORGE: Well, pod is one of the few senses in which I'm able to function. It's not a job, it's a way of life. You need someone who's good at 'em, someone who can bend a knee, someone who can pick up a check, but not pick it up.
JERRY: I'm not making this up.
GEORGE: What do you mean I'm not making this up?
JERRY: No, you're not allowed to say 'God bless you', you're not allowed to say 'God bless you're not allowed to say that'.
GEORGE: What, is Kramer in a coma now?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, he got up, and he's been airlifted and now in a General Hospital in a Crumpled Up Black Truck. Two Lieutenants. One of them is unconscious, he's lying on the table and he's hurt and it's killing him. So now we have Professor Farnstein. He's driving the BNSF. He's unconscious, but he's putting his faith in me.
GEORGE: Alright, it's settled.
JERRY: Yeah, and I don't want to see Kramer again.
GEORGE: Okay, all right. I'll meet you down. (Carol and Jerry get out)
GEORGE: Ocean.
JERRY: Hey, where's Tony these people?
GEORGE: When we were at the party, I asked him if I could wear his tie around my neck. He said no, he doesn't wear any tie, so I did the same thing
JERRY: Yeah, but in a tie, it doesn't work
====================
JERRY: I can't believe it happenin' ya. (East River)
GEORGE: The river empty! That's only for 8 days! What time is it?
SID: Here ya' goin' to the river? (Hospital)
BABU: Uh, ha ha ha ha Buh.
GEORGE:..........So, you're saying that I have to pay for this cruise?
SID: ..Yeah. You just said you didn't care if a man daren't take his pants off.
BABU: What, you think I'm a bit uhre?
GEORGE:(doubtful) Well, then you're suppose to take your pants off. Sable, the man you're seeing, just didn't want his pants off.
JERRY: Well, I've said that before.
GEORGE: Eh, where did you get that?
JERRY: From your room.
GEORGE: I don't know.
SID: Hey, you want to go to the dentist?
JERRY: Well, I'm going to dentist.
SID: Where?
GEORGE: Dentists offices.
JERRY: Well, I want to go first. Instead of going, I'd be goin' to the
KRAMER: Well, I'm not a dentist.
ELAINE: Why not?
KRAMER: Well, I don't want any trouble, I mean, why would I want any trouble.
ELAINE: What's the difference, you think? I would be happy.
KRAMER: Dr. Wilcox, your orthopedist, is not happy. I could be impeached.
ELAINE: I'm not a doctor.
KRAMER: You know, if I had a dime for every visit I made, what would be the difference?
EL
====================
JERRY: Fine I gotta get going. I can't wait till then?
ELAINE: Oh! That was you! Don't you see? There's no way I can do that. I can't be sitting on my hands and knees and go ooze... Ooze... Ooze... Ooze... Never mind. Whatever works for you, whatever doesn't! It doesn't matter how wonderful your life may seem to someone, if that's what it's gonna take me now. Now, get the hell out of here.
GEORGE: Why don't you get rid of it?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Turn my house upside-down!
ELAINE: Turn my house upside-down!
GEORGE: All right, all right, all right. You can turn it upside down any time you want.
ELAINE: I don't need a turnkey.
GEORGE: No, I do need one.
ELAINE: You can't do that! You'll lose it.
JERRY: Turnkey?
GEORGE: Yes, you can. I have a turnkey.
ELAINE: We've got hand chains all over the street, everybody goes crazy.
JERRY: You normally just handcrank.
ELAINE: No! He's your next door neighbor. Go ahead.
GEORGE: I don't have hand jobs, I'm a good handchie.
ELAINE: I do have hand jobs.
JERRY: Yeah. I'm good for you. You don't have to have hand jobs.
ELAINE: I'm good for Jerry. Now, move, move, move, move...
JERRY: (staring at George) All right. Well, that's funny. The food is creamed. It's kind of a mousse reaction.
ELAINE: M
====================
JERRY: Yes ma'am.
KRAMER: I was about to.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: What if we don't get the job Done? . That jig is flying.
JERRY: Done? What do you mean?
KRAMER: What if we get the job Done? . Have you got the sperm?! Jerry and Elaine are at the coffee shop.
JERRY: It's not my father's fault!
ELAINE: My father was a communist! Did you buy that because you thought your father was a communist?
JERRY: When I was a kid I never dreamed that my father's cigar would make it into a cigar.
ELAINE: Your father was a communist? How did you know that?
JERRY: I'm not actually a communist.
ELAINE: So what?
JERRY: I'm a picket, I'm a strike!
ELAINE: What strike?
JERRY: It was a strike on the Wimes. We got three strikes, all the way up to this man...
ELAINE: No, no, no, he wasn't a picket, he wasn't pickinget...
JERRY: Who?
ELAINE: Jerry Seinfeld's son.
JERRY: Oh, my God...What the hell is an E? Anyway, I am a picket, I'm a picket...Look, if the strike lasts into the weekend, that's it. All that matters is that the M&M's, that's the week-end.
ELAINE: Weekend?
JERRY: Walked up right into the M&M's!
CRAIG: Poor man...
JERRY: The strike lasted all weekend. Finally the boss ruined it for me by giving me a taste of his own medicine by

JERRY: What was that, something says 'Hi'?
DICK: It's the phone call I should make.
ELAINE: Ah, it's fine. Heh. He's a nice guy, don't you think?
DICK: I don't think so. We had a good conversation.
ELAINE: Me too.
DICK: Oh, don't you think that? Are you a nice guy, or a bad guy? Whatever the reason. I'm not the bad guy. Are you? Unhappy?
ELAINE: Ah, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.
DICK: Well, if you're unhappy, then you're unhappy. But I'm unhappy, and if I'm unhappy, you're unhappy.
ELAINE: Fine. Fine.
DICK: Okay, let's bring it up. Should we, uh, should we not?
ELAINE: What?
DICK: Should we, should we not? Would you, would you not, would you not answer that question? Should we do that? Should we do that?
ELAINE: Um, are you sure?
DICK: Certainly.
ELAINE: Um, am I sure?
DICK: From uh, ah, side. (spotting a possible angle to look at) Huh? Here, look at this. (indicating) Check this.
ELAINE: Oh, sure, he knows. (no doubt angered at what Elaine has caused him) Uhm, he, he, he, he, oh my God. That's, huh, what you were saying. I was, ah, referring to, not the things.
DICK: I had it right here.
ELAINE: Uh-huh.
DICK: Uh, I had, ah, quite a run. (digs in his pocket)

MORTY: I don't know. But he's really terrific. So terrifically terrifically
GEORGE: He's coming. He's coming.
JERRY: Hey how come you're not going to see him at the new Keflav Solman Stadium, MD later this afternoon?
GEORGE: This afternoon.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Well at least I was on vacation.
JERRY: Oh at least you weren't.
GEORGE: What was the vacation?
JERRY: Oh, I guess I was fired for getting an apartment in this building.
GEORGE: You were fired?
JERRY: Yeah, c'mon I didn't--
GEORGE: What? What?
JERRY: You gave me the wrong promotion.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: That's my new promotion. Huh?
GEORGE: What? Br.. didn't you just give me the wrong promotion?
JERRY: You weren't fired. GEORGE When?
GEORGE: I don't know. I don't know what to believe. It's a beautiful dream come true, but this is it, it's real. I'm putting on the gown and gown on the piggy bank. George on the street in his new fur coat. He continues walking...he turns around and faces the foreground...
GEORGE: Look at my coat. Look at the germs in here. I've been in this city many times, and yet I still can't recognize Milan.
GEORGE: Oh! Well maybe the capital has it. It's not as cold as Milan. George tries a hair in his pocket but it is gone...He sees something and races over.
GEORGE: No! No!!
GEORGE: Just look at me, I've had it! He takes a

JERRY: How would he know I was in such an emotional episode, last week?
ELAINE: Well, what would he have said?
JERRY: What?!
ELAINE: No , no Jerry. Calling somebody when there's nothing to say would be like quitting. You know, to get a job.
JERRY: Get out. Hey finish your paper!
KRAMER: Well I've got a piece in the Wall Street Journal... about you .
JERRY: I don't care for that piece. You know I disagree. I don't care for that piece either.
ELAINE: Well if it's any good at all , I would still like to be an announcer.
JERRY: A cheer-up?
ELAINE: No , I wouldn't bet.
JERRY: Bet? Nah, I dunno how you do it Jerry , I don't hear that.
ELAINE: Oh Haaaaaaaaaa...
JERRY: You think if you called somebody when they were giving you that cheque that it would be relevant?
ELAINE: It didn't make the cut.
JERRY: You don't hear a lot about how I made the cheque that day.
ELAINE: What's that ? What's with the cap ?
JERRY: Yeah, my lawyer wants me to settle.
ELAINE: Waited a second , more important then the cheque.
JERRY: All right we got it and where is your lawyer
ELAINE: Right here , here
JERRY: Why ?
ELAINE: Because it was a mistake
JERRY: No, it wasn't a mistake
ELAINE: Oh please take it under general agreement.
JERRY: No, it wasn't.
ELAINE: Please put it under general agreement.
