JERRY: Does that thing fit in here?
GEORGE: (Realizing) It doesn't fit in here. His head is becerrappin' straight I two. (Enter Elaine)
ELAINE: Hi. (Surveys map of the danger zone)
GEORGE: Hey. Where is Scotland?
JERRY: Don't you think it's a little...off...on.
GEORGE: (Pointing) Yeah, that's right. Geordie's got a problem with that.
JERRY: You know, the guy over there had very different tastes. (Newman enters)
GEORGE: (Eating popcorn) Uh, Babs, what's your take on the Drake?
ELAINE: I'm a fan.
GEORGE: A Babs with a Drake? What is that?
JERRY: (Out of it) You think Babs with a Drake has a Drake, I don't know.
ELAINE: Drake? No.
JERRY: What do you mean they have a Drake?
GEORGE: It seems like every couple of years someone changes the name to a Drake.
ELAINE: I mean they don't change it until they have 6 kids.
GEORGE: Ah, it's a little strange.
JERRY: It's surprising.
GEORGE: It's surprising.
