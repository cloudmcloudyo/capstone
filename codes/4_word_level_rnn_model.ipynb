    "As discussed in notebook 3, this notebook will dedicate to build a RNN-LSTM model based on words, rather than characters. In addition, this model would aim to build a generator function that will generate the data on the fly, instead of processing the giant data altogether. With this function, I hope to solve the issue caused by hardware limitation. Furthermore, this model would also add a diversity function that enables to specify the level of creativity that the text will be generated upon."

    "For the character-based model, there were only 59 tokens in total. However for the word-based model I'm building, there would be a lot more -- since every unique word would be a token. I therefore would like to use keras' tokenizer package streamline this process. To use the keras Tokenizer, I have to separate the texts in list first otherwise they would be tokenized on the character level. To make things easier, I'm using the data in```.csv```format. "

    "To test out the diversity function, I used temperature as low as 0.33 and as high as 1.2 to compare the difference. I tried out five characters from the show as the starting line, and generated 10 of 400-word length scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a format perspective, the generated scripts overall follows ```speaking character``` followed by```: ``` and the corresponding line. As punctuation was separated from the texts and added back later on, the model didn't learn how the punctuation works. The punctuation formatting was coded after the model was trained. With this regard, character-level has the advantage as special characters are trained along with regular ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grammar-wise, no typo was found which was expected as the generated text were based on real word therefore the model didn't need to learn the spelling. Although still sometimes minor errors such as having special character in front of words. i.e ```*mr*!``` The scripts make grammatic sense and in a lot of the time make semantic sense as well, which is a big improvement from the character level model. However still in many scripts the characters did not finish a complete sentence before moving on to the next line. i.e.: ```i don't even know where the hell is--``` And there was also cases although rare, where below script was generated ```S-e-r-t-n-la-la-la-la-la-la-hoo-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t```\n",

    "Content-wise, thanks to the diversity function I was able to specify how creative I would like the script to be. Based on the scripts generated, the lower the temperature is, the more likely to have singular prediction, as seen in the character level model. For those scripts fewer grammar errors were made and each line was complete with a meaning, although not much plot going on. With diveristy value over 1.2, many interesting scripts are generated, while at the cost of grammar accuracy. The model learned to generate most scene description inside the parenthese yet sometimes you can still find words that should definitely be inside the parentheses but were not, which is a result of data not being completely cleaned (as mentioned in the EDA section). However what I found very inspiring is that from some scripts, links between lines extended beyond not one, not two, but several lines.\n",
