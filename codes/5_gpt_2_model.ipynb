      "KRAMER: Yeah, well I'm his.\n",
      "JERRY: You know what? He gets arrested.\n",
      "KRAMER: Yeah, and then you run out and get some food.\n",
      "JERRY: He wouldn't know.\n",
      "KRAMER: Hey, that's a big idea. I get egg salad for 19.\n",
      "JERRY: Used to get salad for 19.\n",
      "KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey. What's 19 again?\n",
      "JERRY: It's a new low.\n",
      "KRAMER: What, you got a problem with soup?\n",
      "JERRY: No. I mean did you get tuna for 19 or was it just for 3? I don't really know the exact number, but I think it was 19.\n",
      "JERRY: Oh, what do you mean you don't like soup?\n",
      "KRAMER: What, what about 19?\n",
      "JERRY: What does it mean?\n",

      "KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a machine. It swaps two ounces for a thousand, and you get a pound.\n",
      "JERRY: Kramer, you know what I'm talking about. I saw Fulton and Macaulay Culkin walking down the street in a Chinese restaurant.\n",
      "KRAMER: So there they are, one vendor and one stop. And that means there's gotta be at least two restaurants a day, and they have to have a separate entrance and exit.\n",

      "KRAMER: Why don't you take a steam?\n",
      "JERRY: No, I'm just thinking. The steam's a three hundred proof, steam. Cab ride I got on the bus. Jerry goes to the elevators. As he comes to, he's slowed by the steam. He hears a rustle.\n",

So I grabbed the handle and yanked it at them, and then as I came down (points), they yanked the knife back at me, yanked it at Jerry; pushed him forward (25, 86, see now in NYC today) and made very rough movements with it. So that's the one. So that's the knife.\n",
