The man is \\n               in the car, the woman walks by the front \\n               of the car, he honks: (imitates horn).\\n               \\n               \\n               THE END \\n\\n'"

       "'GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS            Written by   Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld(Comedy club)              JERRYYou know, why we\\'re here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about \"We should go out\"? This is what they\\'re talking about...this whole thing, we\\'re all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we\\'re all out! There are people tryin\\' to find us, they don\\'t know where we are. (imitates one of these people \"tryin\\' to find us\"; pretends his hand is a phone) \"Did you ring?, I can\\'t find him.\" (imitates other person on phone) \"Where did he go?\" (the first person again) \"He didn\\'t tell me where he was going\". He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you\\'re staring around, whatta you do? You go: \"We gotta be getting back\". Once you\\'re out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it\\'s my feeling, you\\'ve gotta go. (Pete\\'s luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.)               JERRYSeems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. (talking about George\\'s shirt) The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it: it\\'s too high! It\\'s in no-man\\'s-land, you look like you live with your mother.               GEORGEAre you through? (kind of irritated)               JERRYYou do of course try on, when you buy?               GEORGEYes, it was purple, I liked it, I don\\'t actually recall considering the buttons.               JERRYOh, you don\\'t recall?              GEORGE(pretends he\\'s talking into a microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.               JERRYWell, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. (a waitress approaches the table)               WAITRESSMister Seinfeld. (she pours coffee in his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her)               GEORGEAre, are you sure this is decaf? Where\\'s the orange indicator?               WAITRESSIt\\'s missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it\\'s very challenging work. (ironically)               JERRYCan you relax, it\\'s a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.               WAITRESSTrust me George: no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. (she pours the coffee and walks away)               GEORGEHow come you\\'re not doin\\' the second show tomorrow?               JERRYWell, there\\'s this uh, woman might be comin\\' in.               GEORGEWait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?               JERRYI told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?               GEORGENo, you didn\\'t!              JERRYI thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...(looks in the milk can) There\\'s no milk in here, what...               GEORGEWait wait wait, what is she, (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) what is she like?               JERRYOh, she\\'s really great. I mean, she\\'s got like a real warmth about her and she\\'s really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.               GEORGE(with a big smile) So, ya know, what, what happened?               JERRYOh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.               GEORGEOh, nothing happened, but it was...               JERRYYeah.              GEORGEThis is great!              JERRYYeah.              GEORGESo, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!               JERRYYeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we\\'ll get together.               GEORGE(whistles disapproving) Ho ho ho, \"Had to\"? \"Had to come in\"?               JERRYYeah, but...              GEORGE\"Had to come in\" and \"maybe we\\'ll get together\"? \"Had to\" and \"Maybe\"?               JERRYYeah!              GEORGENo...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you\\'re not gonna see this woman.               JERRY(indignant) What, are you serious...why, why did she call?               GEORGEHow do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.               JERRYTo be polite? You are insane!              GEORGEAll right, all right, I didn\\'t want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?               JERRYYes!              GEORGEYou\\'re a back-up, you\\'re a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!               JERRYOh, I get it, this is about the button.               GEORGE(The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block) Claire, Claire, you\\'re a woman, right?               CLAIREWhat gave it away, George?              GEORGEUhm...I\\'d like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.               JERRY(to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?               GEORGE(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to (makes some gestures to accent \"has to\") come to New York on business...               JERRYOh you are beautiful! (ironically)               GEORGEand, and maybe (again some gestures) she\\'ll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?               CLAIREI\\'d have to say: uuhh, no. (George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely: NO)               GEORGE(to Claire) So why did she call?              CLAIRETo be polite.              GEORGETo be polite, I rest my case.              JERRYGood. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you\\'re talking about, now, come on, come with me (stands up), I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.               GEORGEI\\'m not gonna watch you do laundry.               JERRYOh, come on, be a \"come-with-guy\".               GEORGECome on, I\\'m tired.              CLAIRE(to Jerry) Don\\'t worry, I gave him a little caffeine: he\\'ll perk up.               GEORGE(takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics) Right, I knew I felt something...! (Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile) (Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers)               GEORGEJerry? I have to tell ya somethin\\':...this is the dullest moment I\\'ve ever experienced. (walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry)               JERRYWell, look at this guy! Look, he\\'s got everything, he\\'s got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.               GEORGEI need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...               JERRYAnd you didn\\'t even hear how she sounded.               GEORGEWhat?!              JERRYLaura.              GEORGEI can\\'t believe: (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!               JERRYYeah, but how could you be so sure?               GEORGE(gets up) \\'Cause it\\'s signals, Jerry (starts snapping his fingers), it\\'s signals! Don\\'t you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin\\' tomorrow night, if you were busy?               JERRYNo.              GEORGEShe calls you today and she doesn\\'t make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It\\'s Saturday night!               JERRYYeah.              GEORGEWhat is that? It\\'s ridiculous! (Jerry bobs agreeingly) You don\\'t even know, what hotel she\\'s staying at, you can\\'t call her. That\\'s a signal, Jerry, that\\'s a signal! (snaps his fingers again) Signal!               JERRYMaybe you\\'re right.              GEORGEMaybe I\\'m right? Of course I\\'m right.               JERRYThis is insane. You know, I don\\'t even know where she\\'s staying! She, she\\'s not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.               GEORGE(puts an arm around Jerry and whispers) I know, I know. (normal voice) Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don\\'t you just see if it\\'s dried?               JERRYNo no no, don\\'t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it\\'s doing, just let it finish.               GEORGEYou\\'re gonna \"overdry\" it.              JERRYYou, you can\\'t \"overdry\".              GEORGEWhy not?              JERRYSame as you can\\'t \"overwet\". (George looks puzzled) You see, once something is wet, it\\'s wet. Same thing with dead: like once you die you\\'re dead, right? Let\\'s say you drop dead and I shoot you: you\\'re not gonna die again, you\\'re already dead. You can\\'t \"overdie\", you can\\'t \"overdry\".               GEORGE(looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry) Any questions?               JERRYHow could she not tell me where she was staying? (George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops working and George closes the lid)               GEORGE(points to the dryer) Look at that: they\\'re done! It\\'s a miracle! (Jerry looks surprised) (Comedy club)              JERRY\"Laundry-day\" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it\\'s dark, there\\'s bubbles happening, they\\'re all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear: \"C\\'mon babe, let\\'s gather\". You come by, you open up the lid and they\\'ll: (shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid)...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they\\'re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before: (sock\\'s voice) \"Tomorrow, the dryer, I\\'m goin\\'...you wait here!\" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don\\'t see him and then he goes down the road (shows how the sock is going down the road). They got buttons sewed on their faces: join the puppet show...So they\\'re showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn\\'t your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first. (Jerry\\'s apartment. Jerry is watching TV)              JERRY(The phone rings. He picks it up and says:) If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don\\'t say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I\\'m sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no (somebody knocks at the door) Yeah? (to the door, while still at the phone)               KRAMER(enters) Are you up?              JERRY(To Kramer) Yeah...(in the phone) Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem (hangs up the phone).               KRAMERBoy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?               JERRY(upset) Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it\\'s a tape! (actually I can\\'t understand the name; maybe \"Kramer\" wasn\\'t named \"Kramer\" in the pilot!) I taped the game, it\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.               KRAMERHey, I\\'m sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...(takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets) You got any meat?               JERRY(a little irritated) Meat? I don\\'t, I don\\'t know, go...hunt! (Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in) Well what, what happened in the game anyway?               KRAMER(still with his head in the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that\\'s what happened! (takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it) Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.               JERRY(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven\\'t been out of the building in ten years!               KRAMERYeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a \"what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look\" and Kramer asks:) Are you done with this?               JERRYNo.              KRAMER(glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table) When you\\'re done, let me know.               JERRYYeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.               KRAMERI thought I wasn\\'t allowed to be in here this weekend.               JERRYNo, it\\'s OK now, that, that girl is not comin\\' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.               KRAMERYou want me to talk to her?              JERRYI don\\'t think so.              KRAMEROh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. (shows with his fingers how close it was)               JERRYThat close, huh?              KRAMERYou better believe it. (The phone rings. Jerry picks it up)               JERRYHello...Oh, hi, Laura.              KRAMERGive me it...let me talk to her (continues this way).               JERRY(gestures Kramer to shut up) No believe me, I\\'m always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...(Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on TV)...               KRAMERA SLIDE!...Wow!              JERRY...No, it\\'s, it\\'s just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it (takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on) ten-fifteen...No, don\\'t be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it\\'s no trouble at all...I\\'ll see you tomorrow...great, bye. (hangs up the phone; to Kramer:) I, I don\\'t believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here! (Jerry\\'s apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress)               JERRYIf my father was moving this he\\'d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth) Have you got your end?...Your end\\'s got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end\\'s got to come down.               GEORGEYa know, I can\\'t believe you\\'re bringin\\' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don\\'t you bring in an extra guy too? (sits down)               JERRY(hands George a beer) Look, it\\'s a very awkward situation, I, I don\\'t wanna be presumptuous.               GEORGEAll right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?               JERRYAll right, she said she couldn\\'t find a decent hotel- room...               GEORGEA decent hotel-room...              JERRYYeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.               GEORGEYou can\\'t be serious. This is New York city: there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? (waves with his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!               JERRY(cynical) This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?               GEORGEI think I was affected by the caffeine. (suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch) HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG (etc.)               KRAMER(walks in behind the dog and closes the door) He really likes you, George.               GEORGE(ironically) Well, that\\'s flattering.               KRAMER(the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet) Oh, he\\'s getting\\' a drink of water. (sees the mattress on the floor) Is this for that girl?               JERRYYeah.              KRAMERWhy even give her an option?              JERRYThis is a person I like, it\\'s not: \"How to score on spring break\".               GEORGERight, can we go? \\'Cause I\\'m double-parked, I\\'m gonna get a ticket.               JERRYYeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.               GEORGESo what? That\\'s good.              JERRYNow, how could that be good?              GEORGEBecause filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin\\' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin\\' over: \"I\\'ve gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.               JERRYThis is how you operate?              GEORGEYeah, I wish.              JERRYLet me just wipe the sink.              KRAMER(stands up from the couch and yells.) WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? (Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress) It\\'s unbelievable.               GEORGEYeah.              KRAMER...How\\'s the real estate-business?               GEORGE...(surprised he asked) It\\'s uh, not bad, it\\'s comin\\' along...Why? Did you need something.               KRAMERDo you handle any of that commercial...real estate?               GEORGEWell, I might be getting in to that.               KRAMER(slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!               GEORGEI\\'m aware of you, all right, let\\'s go (opens the bathroom door), let\\'s go! (Jerry and the dog come out) You\\'re on stage in 25 minutes. (Comedy club.)              JERRYThe dating world is not a fun world...it\\'s a pressure world, it\\'s a world of tension, it\\'s a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, \\'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don\\'t know what they need. I know I don\\'t have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I\\'m, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we\\'re all human beings, what is the story? I\\'ve never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I\\'ve never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: \"I could use a cotton-ball right now\"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don\\'t need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they\\'re like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They\\'re huge and two days later, they\\'re out, they\\'re gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin\\' with them? The only time I ever see\\'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there\\'s two or three, that look like they\\'ve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don\\'t know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who\\'s left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don\\'t know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: \"Let\\'s move on\"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let\\'s face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night.

Women, they\\'re so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that\\'s it!...It\\'s the only thing we know for sure, it really is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don\\'t know \\'bout that, we don\\'t know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we\\'ve had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks: (imitates horn).THE END'"
